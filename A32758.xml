         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Points Controverted in this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, are not of the leaſt moment to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, all Reducible to theſe two great Queſtions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1. Whether our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Suffering, bore the Perſonal guilt of any or no?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2. Whether our Inherent Obedience to the New Law, be the Righteouſneſs by which a Believer is Juſtified before God?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The firſt Queſtion comes to be diſcuſſed upon the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie <hi>about change of Perſons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the change of Perſons between Chriſt and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, conſiſted in Chriſt being made ſin for us by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of our ſins to him in a legal Sence, and a Believers being made the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and both by tranſaction of our Perſonal guilt and puniſhment (due to us) for Sin, to Chriſt; and of his righteouſneſs in bearing ſin and puniſhment, to us. This change of Perſons the Scripture aſſerts in plain Words
<pb facs="tcp:41447:3"/>
               <hi>2 Cor. 5.21.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> aſſerts, <hi>Report, p. 13.</hi> and the Biſhop denies, and ſaith, That the change was not in <hi>reſpect of the guilt of Sin, becauſe Chriſt bore the Perſonal guilt of none, and whatever Chriſt did or ſuffered, the perſonal guilt of ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains on Believers and can never be taken away.</hi> But he tells us of a kind of Change that he is for, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt was puniſht, that we might not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht,</hi> and this is all our <hi>ſtead</hi> that Chriſt ſtood in; now if Chriſt ſtood <hi>not in our ſtead as Sinners,</hi> and he was not made Sin for us, its to aſſert that which is Expreſly contrary to Scripture, and moſt irrational to men of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding as ſhall be made appear. And the Change which is pretended by the Biſhop is no change in the ſence of the Spirit of God, at beſt it can be but a partial change, neither as a Publick perſon, nor in the Room of the Sinner as ſuch: It is ſuch a change as when three perſons are condemned, and they are thro' the mercy of the Legiſlator to caſt Lots for their lives, one only to die; now be on whom Deaths Lot falls, dieth that in the event the other may not die, yet this Perſon dieth but in Relation to his own Sins, not upon the account of the others Sins: Many Inſtances might be given of the like Nature, where a Man does or ſuffer for another, that the other may not; and here is a change of Perſons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Punity and Impunity, but <hi>Note,</hi> that its no true Change, if Deſert remains on the Original Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor; and the Sufferer ſuffer under no Deſert, neither is ſuch Sufferings Puniſhment in any Law Sence, neither can that Perſon be ever Righteouſneſs, that ſtandeth in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Guilt of his Sin unremoved; but this is not the Place to enlarge on this Point.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only Note, that in one thing the Biſhop got the <hi>Weather-gage</hi> of Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> having in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Terms renounced that Change of Perſons, which Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> Aſſerts. The Biſhop very honeſtly proves, that
<pb facs="tcp:41447:3"/>Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> aſſerted no other Change of Perſons, then what Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> contends for, and therein he hath done Juſtice both to Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lob;</hi> and truly its but a ſorry Buſineſs of any Man of Learning and Ingenuity, to inveigh highly againſt the Opinion of another, as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when he himſelf is neceſſitated by his Principles to hold the ſame thing, only a little differing in way of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Neither let the Reader think, that I appear to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s appealing to the Biſhop, for I was always against it, and declared to him, how much I and others was offended at it, and at his nauſeous fawning and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of him, as if he intended to lay down his Faith at his Feet, for he could not but know the Biſhops ſettled O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in this Point (as I told him) by the Letters he wrote to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> yea, and to himſelf before his Appeal, and then if ſo, what a piece of Pageantry was it in him to Appeal to the Biſhop? but it must be done, it ſeems the Wind of his Phantaſie without any Reaſon hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him this Way, the Iſſue whereof is that, were Mr. <hi>L.</hi> alive, he would ſee he is inevitably run a ground; and therefore, although I can't get him off as to that matter yet, I hope to ſee the Truth ſafe, the main Thing which the Good Man contended for, for I am not to defend Men who will have their Imprudencies and Imperfections, but the good Cauſe he defended.</p>
            <p>The Second great Thing I contend for, is <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> that it is the <hi>only Righteouſneſs that a Believer is juſtified by;</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphr.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clerk</hi> Aſſert our Juſtification by a Believers own inherent Righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> by their Works of <hi>Obedience to the New Law,</hi> a Tenent that hath an inſeparable Connexion unto the former. I ſhall not detain the Reader any longer therein, but refer him to the Treatiſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I finding in the Biſhops Treatiſe, a Preſentation of the <hi>Independants,</hi> brought in by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> for holding ſeveral <hi>Antinomian Principles</hi> which the Rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb facs="tcp:41447:4"/>calls Bane and Poyſon, in that Form of Prayer which he hath taught his Diſciples. I have thought it requiſite to Entitle my Book accordingly <hi>Alexipharmacon,</hi> and though I take the Rebuker to be of too haughty a Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution (abounding in Choler) to be my Patient, yet I am not diſcouraged from expoſing this Preparation to Publick Advantage, not doubting but ſome may reap Benefit thereby; and hence I have endeavoured alſo to correct the Druggs, which the unskilful Rebuker hath cast away with his <hi>prophane Faugh, for Bane and Poyſon;</hi> and ſhew, that if they be but a little ſcraped and wip'd from the Dirt and Filth, which he and his ſlovenly Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath put upon them, they will become a Christians wholeſome Food, and ſubſtantial Medicine, being the <hi>Fruit and Leaves of the Tree of Life for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nations,</hi> Rev. <hi>22.2.</hi>

            <head>SOME REMARKS UPON <hi>The B. of</hi> W.<hi>s' diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of Satisfaction, in Anſwer to Mr.</hi> L.<hi>'s</hi> Appeal.</head>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpend time in rectifying what the B. ſaith concerning the occaſion of the <hi>preſent difference,</hi> believing the B. ſaith nothing in this Matter but what he had from one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concern'd, who gave him, as appears, a very <hi>unfair and partial repreſentation</hi> of theſe things, as they have done elſewhere; and therefore becauſe I will not <hi>actum agere, I refer the Reader to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Union,</hi> and <hi>of the cauſes of the Breach thereof,</hi> and counſel him as a Lover of Truth, to believe no more of what the B. writes on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than what he finds is conſonant to the <hi>ſaid Hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. I therefore paſs over to the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Myſtery of Antinom. laid open;</hi> and <hi>firſt,</hi> I muſt take notice of the B. Conceſſion.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41447:6"/>
            <p>
               <hi>That if there were no more in the controverſie than what is contained in theſe terms, Relative</hi> [or Connexive] <hi>Conditions, and Faederal, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie might fairly and eaſily been accommodated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe this <hi>accommodation</hi> muſt have been by granting this disjunction to be true, and according to the rules of diſtribution, <hi>That a condition is that which is Axiomatically expreſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexive conjunction Si,</hi> If, and is the Logical knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together of an <hi>Antecedent and Conſequent,</hi> but doth not neceſſarily import the connexion of cauſe and effect, but of a uſual or requiſite depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; ſuch as is between <hi>Antecedent and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</hi> e. gr. If I go to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> I muſt go out of my own houſe; if I <hi>paſs into Glory, I muſt paſs thro' the State of Grace;</hi> not that the ſtate of Grace is <hi>any meritorious cauſe of Glory,</hi> but that there is ſuch a cauſe of both, and to which both anſwer as effects equally, altho' one precede the other in order. But <hi>faederal conditions</hi> are quite of another nature, of a covenant and moral nature; a covenant, having but two parts, the <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>promiſe made upon the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> by the party required ſo to do, whereby the good thing promiſed, upon the ſaid performance of the condition is <hi>demandable</hi> by the performer, as <hi>due debt</hi> to him. Hence it's the <hi>faederal nature</hi> of the condition, not the greatneſs or ſmallneſs of the condition that makes it <hi>meritorious.</hi> If God had ſaid unto man in Paradice, <hi>Take up this leaf or that ſtraw,</hi> and thou ſhalt live for ever, eternal life had been his due, upon his doing thereof, and demandable by him, and the covenant made it ſo; <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>due debt, ex pacto,</hi> i. e. legally ſo; for a due debt is due in a law ſenſe.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41447:6"/>
            <p>§ 2. Now what hinders this <hi>deſirable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation?</hi> It is the B's opinion that there is a greater miſchief in Antinomianiſm, <hi>[a Snake in the Graſs]</hi> which ought to be laid open, to prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of it. Antinomianiſm the B. knows in true notation of the word, and according to the ſenſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> is a denial of the Juſtification of a ſinner by our own works of the law, the miſchief that attends it is only occaſional, by reaſon of men's corruption, <hi>viz.</hi> The vileneſs of corrupt and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate minds in the abuſe of the grace of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to embolden themſelves, <hi>to ſin, becauſe grace abounds;</hi> which the Apoſtle was aware of, and warns us againſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. It is not any fault in the doctrine it ſelf. Well, but <hi>what</hi> is the miſchief the B. finds? <q>
                  <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this, all this diſpute about conditions on our part depends upon another; and if that hold, this muſt follow as a conſequence of it, and ſeveral other things which Dr.</hi> Criſp <hi>ſaw very well, had a neceſſary connexion with each other, like a fair dealer in controverſie, owned them all.</hi>
               </q> Here I cannot but acknowledge the <hi>greet ingenuity</hi> of the B. beyond many others, in not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owning him a <hi>fair dealer</hi> in this controverſie that he oppoſeth him in, but in his after vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him from thoſe <hi>falſe imputations,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his adverſaries would faſten upon him ſo far, that he leaves him a mere <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> and no worſe.</p>
            <p>§. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 74. B. I come therefore to the next thing in the firſt Paper, <q>
                  <hi>wherein you ſay</hi> [i. e. <hi>Mr.</hi> L.] <hi>clears the diſſenting brethren from the charge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm,</hi> Report, p. 13. Rem. p. 11. <hi>Your words are,</hi> [i. e. <hi>Mr.</hi> L.<hi>'s</hi>] <hi>That touching a Change of Perſons between Chriſt and believers, there is no phyſical change, whereby Chriſt and believers do in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41447:7"/>ſtance become one another, nor a moral change, whereby Chriſt ſhould become inherently ſinful, and Believers thereby become immediately innocent, and ſinleſs, but the change is only in a legal ſenſe by conſent between the Father and him, putting on the perſon, and coming into the room and ſtead of ſinners,</hi> &amp;c,</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is laid down for the truth of this change by Mr. <hi>L.</hi> but yet Mr. <hi>L.</hi> peremptorily diſowns Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s change of Perſons, as well as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Now the B. doth very fairly ſhew and prove, that Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> intended no other change of Perſons than what Mr. <hi>L.</hi> aſſerts to be the truth, and a clearing the aſſertors from the charge of Antinom. <hi>Now ſaith he, I ſhall make it appear that you have not herein diſowned Dr.</hi> Criſp<hi>'s ſence of the change of perſons;</hi> ſo far I cannot but ſay, that the B. hath done right to Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> and Mr. <hi>L.</hi> and it's no other than what I ever thought of the controverſie, when on foot. I ſhall not give my ſelf the trouble of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what the B. hath done out of Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s Sermons, to prove his aſſertion. See <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 75, 76, 77.</p>
            <p>§. 4. <q>
                  <hi>This ſeems to be a great Myſtery, but is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the foundation of Antinomianiſm. That Chriſt had the perſonal guilt of our tranſgreſſions charged upon him, and ſo he was as ſinful as we.</hi>
               </q> He ſhould have added <hi>legally,</hi> or in the <hi>eye of the law,</hi> the guilt of our ſins, <hi>the perſonal guilt</hi> of every ſaved one being charged upon him, the <hi>Reatus Culpae non perpetratio culpae;</hi> the debt, <hi>non contractio debiti.</hi> This is the truth of the Goſpel, which will ſtand as a pillar of braſs, when all the wit and malice of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers and banterers thereof will be driven away as chaff before the wind. Here are two aſſertions that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41447:7"/>we muſt ſtand by and defend the truth of againſt the B. and all other oppoſers.</p>
            <p>In the B.'s firſt Letter he tells us what the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 5. <q>
                  <hi>That if there be no change of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons between Chriſt and us, there can be no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the guilt, nor a juſt infliction of the puniſhment of our ſins on Chriſt;</hi> i. e. <hi>there can be no proper ſatisfaction,</hi>
               </q> which is truth without exception. But the B. anſwers, <q>
                  <hi>That there is a twofold tranſlation of guilt to be conſidered.</hi> 1. <hi>Of the perſonal guilt which reſults from the acts of ſin committed by ſuch perſons.</hi>
               </q> Now the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of this guilt of ſin on Chriſt the B. all along denies, and endeavours to diſprove, 1. Perſonal guilt can be no other than the guilt of the Perſon that had committed the ſin, for which he is arraign'd at the Bar of God's Law, <hi>e. gr. John</hi> hath ſtolen, <hi>Thomas</hi> hath committed murder, and neither the guilt of <hi>John</hi>'s theft, nor of <hi>Thomas</hi>'s murder was transferred to Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>David</hi>'s murder and adultery in the guilt thereof was not transferred to Jeſus Chriſt, nor the guilt of <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſin in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maſter. This is the meaning of the B. doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He gives his reaſon; <q>
                  <hi>If this guilt be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Chriſt muſt become the very perſon who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſins, and ſo become an actual Sinner; yea, as the Perſon that committed all the ſins of thoſe for whom he died.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder ſo learned a man ſaw not the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this arguing, which he took up from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who never ſtuck at any groſs arguments to beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the moſt glorious Goſpel truths. The force of the argument is thus unfolded, and made very plain. If a debt be tranſlated from one man to another, then he to whom it is tranſlated muſt be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41447:8"/>as the perſon that contracted the debt; but the B. ſaith, We muſt not look upon ſins as debts, which we ſhall ſpeak to in its place; but let us uſe another inſtance, If a thing done by one man be accounted to another, <hi>e. gr.</hi> a Repreſentative in Parliament, is that thing to be thought to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and perſonally performed by the perſons to whom it's accounted. The Repreſentatives of the people in <hi>Denmark</hi> gave up the liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the King's prerogative, the people by them are accounted to have done it by the Repreſentatives, muſt therefore every Subject be ſaid actually and perſonally to have done it, when doubtleſs Hundreds of lovers of the country hated and deteſted the Action, tho' as neceſſarily included therein, as if they had actually done it. Many Inſtances of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be given, tho' theſe are enough to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the falſeneſs of the B's odious conſequence; and we may as well wonder that any that bear any reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our bleſſed Saviour, ſhould not abhor ſuch dirty and irrational conſequences as theſe are, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſo expreſly contrary to the word of God and common reaſon. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3. Hence theſe men dare not but ſay there is a guilt tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt: I pray what guilt? Is it not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? Is there any guilt in the world beſides what is of one Perſon or another? But our B. will find out a guilt that's not perſonal, which we will examine.</p>
            <p>§. 5. The other branch of his diviſion of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of guilt, <q>
                  <hi>is of Legal Guilt,</hi> which he ſaith <hi>lyes in an obligation to Puniſhment by virtue of the Sanction of the Divine Law. Now this guilt implies two things;</hi> 1. <hi>The deſert of Puniſhment which follows perſonal guilt, and cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by change of perſons,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>The obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41447:8"/>to undergo the deſerved puniſhment, here may intervene a change of perſons,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, Now obſerve what kind of guilt the B. will have Chriſt to bear: 1. He ſaith it's legal guilt, but what's that according to him? It's the <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to puniſhment, and that's in the ſanction of the law;</hi> i. e. it's ſubjectively in the law, hence it's the <hi>guilt of the law</hi> that Chriſt muſt bear, and not the guilt of any perſon. It's true, that obligation to puniſhment is formally in the law, and therefore obligation to puniſhment cannot be called guilt, but <hi>guilt is of a perſon tranſgreſſing</hi> the law, not in the law tranſgreſſed. 2. He ſaith this guilt implies two things: What is the meaning of implies? Is it that the laws obligation of a tranſgreſſor to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſſentially contains in it thoſe two things? 1. An actual deſert of puniſhment, and obligation of ſome Perſon to undergo it. Surely not, for if the law had never been tranſgreſſed, it had contain'd this in it; that if ever any do deſerve it, they ſhall be obliged to puniſhment. 2. Doth it imply theſe integrally their deſert of puniſhment, and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to puniſhment are the parts of the forenamed legal guilt, then the deſert of puniſhment, as well as obligation to puniſhment; <hi>i. e.</hi> no other than the fault muſt lye in the law, for it can't be in more ſubjects than one, and the B. muſt come under the force of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> if he will allow any ſuch thing as guilt, that it is <hi>ſubjectively</hi> in ſome perſon, and ſo <hi>perſonal,</hi> or <hi>in the law it ſelf.</hi> Now there's no <hi>fault</hi> in the law, therefore no <hi>guilt.</hi> 3. He ſaith, deſert of puniſhment <hi>follows perſonal guilt,</hi> but by his favour it is perſonal guilt it ſelf, the <hi>merit of puniſhment</hi> is in the fault, the very <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for what deſerves puniſhment but ſin, to which the law
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41447:9"/>makes the wages of Death due; <hi>not continuing in all things written in the law?</hi> The law enquires no further than it finds the fault, wherein it hath found the deſert; it's formally and eſſentially in it; it's true, the ſentence follows this, but the deſert lyes in the eſſential moral contrariety of the action to the obedience of the law required it; the wiſdom of God ſaith, the taking away of guilt is to take away ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He aſſerts, but hath not proved, <q>
                  <hi>That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guilt can't be transferred by change of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi>
               </q> His ſtrong reaſon is, <hi>For no man can ceaſe to deſerve puniſhment for his own faults, nor deſerve that another ſhould be puniſhed for them.</hi> The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is, that <hi>perſonal guilt</hi> can't be transferred; then certainly no guilt at all; for there is no guilt but is perſonally contracted, and perſonally adhering, and therefore Chriſt bore no guilt of Sin at all, moſt contrary to Scripture, and the very known nature of a ſurety, which always is in bearing the ſin of the tranſgreſſor by change of perſons. 2. He argues to prove it, <hi>That no man can ceaſe to deſerve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for his own faults.</hi> An excellent aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If ſo, I am ſure God can't ceaſe to puniſh him, for he renders to every one according to his deſerts, he is a juſt God. 2. This poſition throws down the whole ſatisfaction of Chriſt at one blow; for if Chriſt hath not taken off the perſonal deſert of ſin from any, he hath not ſatisfied the law; for if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the B. he takes off the legal obligation of any to puniſhment, he takes off the deſert by the law. 3. It will follow, that not only believers, but the glorified Saints in Heaven, are ſtill under the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guilt and deſert of puniſhment; and if ſo,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41447:9"/>they can't be in the favour of God, they can't be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without ſpot before the Throne, they are under the perſonal guilt of all their ſins, and this is no ſpot of God's Children, but an eſſential form of a Helliſh State. The B. here hath very inconſiderately run himſelf upon the rocks, tho' with the reſt of the Neonomians he doth ſo frequently charge thoſe that are contrary minded with Shallowneſs, Illiterate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is one thing to <hi>ſin and contract a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guilt,</hi> and another thing to lye <hi>under this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guilt;</hi> ſure bare pardon of ſin by him that hath power to pardon, takes off <hi>perſonal guilt</hi> in the B's ſence, the obligation of the perſon to puniſhment, elſe after pardon the law may take him up again, and would, even in mens proceedings by law; but in God's there's not only the pardon of the ſinner, but a juſt ſatisfaction to the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
            <p>§. 6. The B. adds,— <hi>Nor deſerve that another ſhould be puniſh'd for them.</hi> What will not men of perverſe minds ſay?</p>
            <p>Whoever aſſerted that ſinners deſerved that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer for them, I wonder men are not aſham'd of ſuch groſs impoſitions, quite contrary to the known minds of others, but to the nature of the thing; for where did any debtor or criminal deſerve that another ſhould ſuffer for him, either by his good works, to deſerve ſo much good of another, or by his evil works, to make another, that is neither criminal nor acceſſory, guilty? How much leſs may it be ſaid of us that we deſerved that Chriſt ſhould be puniſhed for us? The B. ſaith Chriſt <hi>was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for us,</hi> the obligation of the law binding us over to puniſhment, and that Chriſt took the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in our ſtead; was it becauſe we deſerv'd it, or not? If it was not becauſe we deſerv'd if, it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41447:10"/>was not in our ſtead; we ſay not that it was in the nature of our ſins to deſerve his puniſhment, but in the grace, wiſdom and juſtice of the Legiſlator. As the B. ſaith, it was of grace of God to find a ranſom, it was of the grace of the Son to give up himſelf unto juſtice for this end, it was to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of divine juſtice to accept of his glorious ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the ſinners room and ſtead; here's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſinner's deſerving that brought Chriſt's ſuffering for the ſinners, but the ſubſtitution of Chriſt, for this end, by the Father and himſelf, tho' the ſinner deſerves puniſhment.</p>
            <p>§. 7. The ſecond thing according to the B. impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <q>
                  <hi>Legal guilt, is obligation to undergo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment, but becauſe the execution of puniſhment depends on the wiſdom and juſtice of the Legiſlator, therefore here a change of perſon may intervene.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> It behoves us to be exact with the B. here, becauſe he acquaints us with a curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this point of change of perſons, that of late men have ſo ſhittlecock'd it up and down, that it's hard to find what either ſide would have, but what they both agreed in, that they would not have it to be what Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> ſaid it was. 1. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the B. diſtinguiſheth the <hi>obligation to undergo the deſerved puniſhment, and execution of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Why ſaith he, <hi>not execution of deſerved puniſhment?</hi> To me it ſeems to be a very ſmatch of <hi>Socinianiſm;</hi> as if Chriſt did not undergo any <hi>deſerved puniſhment,</hi> but only a <hi>puniſhment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſert;</hi> i. e. only <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and not <hi>puniſhment</hi> in any proper ſence. 2. If obligation to undergo the deſerved puniſhment be the guilt only tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Chriſt, then it will follow, it's only the guilt of the law is charged on Chriſt, not of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41447:10"/>ſinner; and it's plain the B. means ſo, for he denies that the guilt of any perſon is charged on Chriſt. 3. He ſaith, this <hi>obligation to puniſhment</hi> is only in the law <hi>and its truth,</hi> therefore he means that this law obligation falling on Chriſt, is all the guilt that falls upon him, and here may be no change of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for tho' the law obligation may fall upon <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> be never the better that it falls on <hi>Thomas,</hi> becauſe it falls not on <hi>Thomas</hi> for the ſake of <hi>John:</hi> But he ſaith, that here a change of perſons may intervene; how? between two perſons to undergo puniſhments? If ſo, it muſt be under one and the ſame law, not a change from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one law, to a being under another. 2. It muſt be a change in reſpect of deſerved puniſhment; for puniſhment cannot be without deſert, it becomes not the wiſdom and juſtice of God that it ſhould be be ſo. 3. If the change be in reſpect of deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved puniſhment, we have gained as much as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; for then the deſert of the ſinner, which is of his fault, and his guilt is tranſlated to Chriſt, becauſe his puniſhment was deſerved, <hi>e. gr.</hi> he bore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment of ſin, of what or whom, of the law; nay, the law never deſerved puniſhment of any perſons; nay, quoth the B. he bore no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guilt, then there is no change in reſpect of deſerved puniſhment; Chriſt ſuffer'd for us, but was not puniſhed for any, he ſuffered no deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? Hence no puniſhment at all, for all juſt puniſhment is due.</p>
            <p>§. 8. He ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>The execution of puniſhment depends on the wiſdom and juſtice of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
               </q> It is true, therefore ought not the execution of puniſhment anſwer the obligation to it? Is it wiſdom and juſtice in God to oblige in his law, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41447:11"/>any puniſhment not deſerved? And is it wiſdom or juſtice in God to oblige in his law to deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and not to execute deſerved puniſhments? For if Chriſt's puniſhments were not deſerved, they were meer ſufferings; and if ſo, no more to us than the ſuffering of a Martyr to us; if deſerved ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then, 1. According to ſome rule of juſtice. 2. Deſerved by himſelf, or ſome others; not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his own individual perſon, you will ſay; therefore by ſome other. Hence if Chriſt bore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhments of others, he bore the guilt of ſin, the <hi>Reatus culpae,</hi> that being the formal deſert of puniſhment, the law making it ſo, either of God or Man. He ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>By the wiſdom and juſtice of God a mediator may be accepted in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as himſelf hath determined, and upon accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his Sacrifice the offenders may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and received into grace and favour of God on ſuch terms as he hath declared in the Goſpel, and in this ſence is the guilt of ſins charged on Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> It is much that theſe men can take upon themſelves a power of directing God, and telling him what he may do, when God hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid that he did or would do ſo, the true Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the B's ſence in this paragraph is by the new-coin'd law, but we will take him in his own terms: And I ſay, in God's execution of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it becomes the wiſdom and juſtice of God to do it according to a promulgated law, which the Legiſlator hath in his wiſdom and juſtice made a manifeſt <hi>Norma Juſtitiae,</hi> to ſhew forth his juſtice, and that God may be juſtified as Judge of all the world, to deal righteouſly, and therefore not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a Sinner or a Mediator for them upon other terms than is in his law expreſs'd, and not upon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41447:11"/>other ſecret and unknown terms. 2. How may God accept of a Mediator? Is it not in ſatisfying: for the ſinner, in bearing the ſinners deſerved puniſhment, and therein taking off the laws obligation of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to puniſhment? God can't otherwiſe do in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or juſtice. 3. He makes God's acceptance of a ſacrifice to be an antecedent of pardon only, not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying and meritorious reaſon thereof. 4. How doth God accept. Chriſt's ſacrifice, as a ſingle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act, done by him, wherein none is concern'd but himſelf; or a qualifying act to God himſelf, to make him able to pardon? Or doth he accept his ſacrifice for ſinners deſerving puniſhment under the law? Taking their deſerts and puniſhment upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then he is a mediatorial ſacrifice; otherwiſe; if the guilt lyes upon perſons unremoved, he is neither a ſacrifice for their ſins, nor accepted of God as ſuch. 5. Is it according to the juſtice of God to accept a ſacrifice for ſinners, whoſe perſonal guilt he never took away thereby, and pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into favour upon other terms afterwards? Sure then the mediator is not accepted till they have performed thoſe conditions, upon which their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and acceptance is laid.</p>
            <p>§. 9. <q>
                  <hi>In anſwer to the Reporter,</hi> p. 8. <hi>he takes occaſion to tell him that the Conſideration of ſins as debts is a wrong notion, and gives up the point of Satisfaction to the Socinians.</hi>
               </q> If it do, it doth but as the B. and his right Reverend Father Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath done, from whom he took up this divinity. It ſeems the ſpirit of God did not ſo well conſider of it as the B. hath done, nor our maſter the Lord Jeſus, when he taught his diſciples to pray ſo; I know it ſticks cruelly in the Neonom. ſtomachs that our Lord Jeſus was ſo raſh and inconſiderate to make uſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41447:12"/>of this word debt for ſin; but why doth this give away the cauſe to <hi>Socinians?</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Becauſe if ſins be conſidered as debts, God may freely forgive them (without diſparagement to his wiſdom and juſtice) without any Satisfaction.</hi>
               </q> But what if God will not? He hath revealed this in his word, that he will by no means acquit the guilty without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; we are not ſpeaking of God's abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but of his ordinate; neither are we ſpeaking of God's acting by his ſoveraign dominion, but by his acting in a way of juſtice; becauſe where there's ſin, there is a law tranſgreſſed, and God's dealing with the ſinner muſt be in a way of juſtice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God repeal his law, or diſpenſe with it, as the Neonom. will have it, but we can't admit thereof. But, 2. Why can't God upon the ſame reaſon forgive a criminal by his prerogative, as well as a debtor? An earthly King may, why not the King of Kings? 3. And why is not ſin a debt in a proper ſence enough? Is it not a debt to God's juſtice, and made ſo by God's law, and treated as ſuch in the very point of Satisfaction? It's ſuch a Debt as muſt be ſatisfied, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.23, and 7.23. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, muſt it of neceſſity be a money debt, and no other? He ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>I can't but wonder at the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed author, that he doth at the ſame time aſſert our ſins to be conſidered as debts, and the neceſſity of vindictive juſtice; for what vindictive juſtice belongs to a creditor?</hi>
               </q> I have rather wondred at the learned Author, that he ſhould be taken with ſuch a <hi>Delirium,</hi> as to ſuppoſe B. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to be for a Commutation of Perſons in <hi>ſano ſenſu,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſufficiently informed by his Letters of his Neonom. principles, before he appeal to him, and flattered him ſo offenſively as he did. But <hi>ad rem,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41447:12"/>1. The B. knew that ſimilitude or metaphorical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions <hi>are not to be forc'd to run on four feet;</hi> for tho' ſins be moſt fitly called debts to the juſtice of God, yet God is not therefore a money creditor, but with <hi>neceſſity of Vindictive Juſtice to a creditor;</hi> ſure, impriſonment is vindictive juſtice, or ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on all that a man hath; doth not God in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſeize on all a ſinner hath by his curſe, and caſt him into priſon till he hath paid the utmoſt Farthing? <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.26. Sure Chriſt's own Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeology might be admitted by us, but it ſeems not by this B. and ſome others; ſee further his Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom. ſpirit; he calls Chriſt's language, in calling ſin debts to God, and aſcribing <q>
                  <hi>Vindictive Juſtice to ſuch an adverſary rude and inconſiſtent, and he can hardly think ſuch ever penetrated into theſe matters, but took up with a ſett of phraſes.</hi>
               </q> I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found theſe Neonom. great boaſters of their own wit, and deep penetration into things; anſwer their adverſaries ſtill more by contemptuous and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious language, than by any fair way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; tho' I muſt confeſs I do not find this learned B. ſo addicted to this foul way of treating thoſe that diſſent from him, as many others of the Neonom. kidney that are far ſhort of him in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gentility.</p>
            <p>The main deſign of this diſcourſe, in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s Appeal, is to ſhew how much the good man was miſtaken, as to believe that he, the B. was for Commutation of perſons in his ſence, but he was for Commutation in Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and the Neonom. ſence. The meaning of all, that there hath been ſuch a ſputter about, and ſo much foul language, unbecoming Chriſtians, much more Miniſters, lyes in this one Queſtion, whether Chriſt was <hi>made of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41447:13"/>God ſin and curſe</hi> for ſinners? And whether the ſaid ſinners believing <hi>become the righteouſneſs of God</hi> in him? The Commutation according to ſcripture lyes here; that <hi>Chriſt inſtead of the guilty ſinner became ſin and curſe, and that the Sinner in Chriſt becomes righteous and guitleſs.</hi> Now ſaith the B. That the change was not in reſpect of ſin, aſſerting that Chriſt bore no perſonal guilt, but that he bore only puniſhment, that we ſhould not be puniſh'd upon our Faith and Repentance; ſo that he muſt hold the Commutation of perſons is not in reſpect of ſin and righteouſneſs, (for that perſon that is taken from the guilt of ſin <hi>in foro juſtitiae,</hi> can never be righteous) but only in reſpect of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and impunity. 4. That Chriſt was puniſh'd, that the ſinner might not, but that this change was not abſolute, but conditional; and to be future upon terms to be performed by one party, when he ſhould have an actual Being in the world, when he ſhould perform the fixed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Faith, Repentance, and good Works. Again, he will not have it ſuch a change as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſurety and debtor, but ſuch a change as is between two private perſons; one doing a good turn for, on the behalf, and ſo inſtead of the other denying Chriſt to be a publick perſon, to be in his Mediatorſhip a ſurety, or legal Repreſentative before God's Tribunal of Juſtice; and this I find every where to be the Neonom. Doctrine: But I ſhall aſſert, that the B's change of perſons is none at all; for if it be not of perſons as ſtanding in relation to the law, it's none at all in a law ſence; Chriſt bearing no guilt by law obligation, and the ſinner being freed from none thereby, this is enough to ſay of it here, my deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſhort, I can't fill up my paper with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41447:13"/>of the very Words which I have tired my ſelf too much in already, nor enter upon a tedious Litigation about Words or Senſe of them; and if Dr <hi>Criſp</hi> or the Bp. have not well expreſs'd themſelves, I leave thoſe Words to themſelves, and apply my ſelf only to the true ſenſe and meaning of the Bp. in that point, which he mainly proſecutes in this treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Bp. <hi>p.</hi> 79. <q>
                  <hi>My buſineſs at preſent is about tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring our very faults upon Chriſt, which Dr.</hi> Criſp <hi>calls the guilt of the fact.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> I need not here tell the Reader that the Aſſertor doth diſtinguiſh between the fact and the guilt of the fact, the <hi>Culpa &amp; reatus culpae;</hi> the Bp. himſelf hath vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him from the charge, of ſaying that the fact it ſelf was charged on Chriſt, <hi>p.</hi> 77. <q>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Criſp <hi>denies Chriſt to be the actual tranſgreſſor, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that he had the perſonal guilt of our Sins upon him, and built his whole Hypotheſis upon it.</hi>
               </q> This then is the Queſtion in ſhort to be diſcuſſed, <hi>Whether Chriſt in his ſufferings bare upon him the perſonal guilt of Sin?</hi> The affirmative is the truth in our judgment, let who will aſſert it; the Bp. holds the negative throughout his treatiſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vertical point, upon which the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of <hi>change of perſons</hi> doth turn.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I deſire to ſpeak as plainly in this matter as may be, and as briefly, and ſhall paſs over all the proofs that the Bp. hath made, that this was the Dr's judgment, with this conceſſion that it was ſo, yea, and all the needleſs remarks, interpretations and banters that he hath upon what the Doctor hath ſaid, and only take notice of the things of weight. But firſt it is neceſſary to ſhew how we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Queſtion.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41447:14"/>
            <p n="1">1. In what capacity Chriſt ſtood when he bore ſin and puniſhment?</p>
            <p n="2">2. In what ſenſe he bore ſin?</p>
            <p n="3">3. What perſonal guilt is?</p>
            <p n="4">4. How Chriſt came to bear perſonal guilt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As to the firſt, that Chriſt ſtood in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a publick perſon, repreſenting the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Elect under the conſideration of the lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Eſtate and Condition in the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, when we ſay <hi>Chriſt bore Sin,</hi> it's neither treaſon or blaſphemy, as our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would have it, becauſe we ſpeak in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Spirit of God; however, to prevent cavilling, we will vouchſafe to yeild to the Bp's term, <hi>perſonal guilt,</hi> which can import no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the committed Sin remaining on the ſinner's perſon and conſcience, as a forbidden and condemned fault by the law; neither do we ſay that Chriſt committed theſe Sins, or was made to have committed them when our Sins were laid upon him, neither that his Nature was phyſically or morally corrupted thereby. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We cannot but adore the wiſdom of God, in calling perſonal guilt Sin, becauſe, 1. A bare phyſical Act as ſuch is not Sin, and as all killing is not ſin, but Sin is a phyſical Act cloathed with a moral Exorbitancy ariſing from its relation to, and comparing with the law of God, therefore, to ſay the <hi>ſubſtratum</hi> of the phyſical act or defect, is transferred from one ſubject to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is moſt abſurd; but the guilt of this fact, and its moral relation to the law, may be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and taken away from the ſubject tranſgreſſor, as we ſhall make it appear.</p>
            <p>As to the third, the Bp. tells us what he means by perſonal guilt, and it's very plain. <hi>David</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guilt was of Murder and Adultery, ſo <hi>Peter</hi>'s
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41447:14"/>of denying his Maſter. Now the Bp. will not have <hi>perſonal guilt</hi> ever to be taken off from any, but that <hi>David</hi> continues in Heaven under perſonal guilt of Murder and Adultery to this Day, and for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Chriſt came to bear Sin; 1. By God's call, and his acceptance, voluntarily obeying his Father's command. 2. In ſubmitting himſelf to a legal way of proceeding with him when he came under the ſame law the tranſgreſſor was under. 3. By a legal accounting and imputing our Sin to him, he coming <hi>in forum Juſtitiae,</hi> and writing himſelf debtor in the room and ſtead of all the inſolvent debtors to the Law of God, Juſtice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of him as a ſufficient Paymaſter. Hence in the <hi>law ſenſe</hi> Chriſt was called by God, what he was not in a <hi>natural ſenſe, Rom.</hi> 4. He was made Sin, who knew no Sin; and God calls things that are not, as tho' they were, both in calling Chriſt Sin, and us Righteous.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Now we ſay that <hi>Commutation of Perſons,</hi> was ſo far, and no more nor leſs than God hath made it to be in his legal way of proceeding in this great myſtery: That Chriſt ſhould according to the Preordination and Conſtitution of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, freely put himſelf under a <hi>judicial Proceſs</hi> for the Sins of all the Elect under the ſame law that they tranſgreſſed, and that Juſtice ſhould deal with him as if he had been the original tranſgreſſor; and in the ſtead thereof, in transferring the charge upon him, and puniſhing him for Sin. Hereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the change, that <hi>he is made Sin, and we Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in him,</hi> Juſtice receiving full ſatisfaction for our Sins. Hence we ſhall not much trouble our ſelves with the many odious Inferences that the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41447:15"/>Neonom. would draw upon this glorious Myſtery, nor the dirty Reflections on the unſearchable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the Truth being as fully and plainly made manifeſt in Holy Writ, as any doctrine of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is plain that Sin was laid on Chriſt in ſome ſence or other, the Scripture being ſo expreſs in it. 2. It's granted on all hands the phyſical part of the Act was not transferred to Chriſt; after which, that which remains on the Sinner is the guilt of it, which is his relation to the law in the moral ſenſe, as a tranſgreſſor, and muſt be his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the laws condemnation of the Fact making his guilt or deſert of puniſhment. 3. The Spirit of God calls this Merit or Deſert, Sin, and ſhall we call it contrary to Scripture? Where doth the Scripture ſay it was not? It ſaith again and again that it was, and what if contrary to the Bp's reaſon? Are we to believe God or Man? Is the Bp's reaſon the rule of our Faith? What if the ſame word be uſed in Scripture for Sin and Puniſhment? I grant that one word in Hebrew is uſed for Sin, and the Sacrifice for Sin ſometimes; but when it's uſed for the Sacrifice, it's therefore uſed, becauſe Sin was judicially transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Sacrifice; that it bore the Sin of the Tranſgreſſor, ſo that it became the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of its Suffering; and therefore it's denominated from its moſt eſſential cauſe. To ſay it's a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical word, is not much to the purpoſe, it being ſuch as expreſſeth the very nature of the thing as often in Scripture by a Metonimy, <hi>Senſus pornitur pro ſenſili,</hi> a Grace of the Spirit put for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Faith for the Object, and Hope for its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſo here Sin for the perſonal guilt of Sin, the Subject put for an eſſential or proper Production:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41447:15"/>It's a Metan. of another nature from that, this is my Body, where <hi>Signum</hi> is put for <hi>Signatum,</hi> and its true the Scripture doth always denote the guilt of Sin <hi>by Sin,</hi> and the Bp. doth concede, <hi>that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is not Sin,</hi> but a Conſequent of guilt; we ſay it's more than a mere Conſequent, it is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited effect, and Sin always deſerves and merits Puniſhment, tho' no Sinner merited, that a Surety ſhould be puniſhed for him; this is by Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Surrogation</hi> or Subſtitution. And it's to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Scripture, to make Puniſhment ſeparable from guilt, and for good reaſon to; for no juſt Law pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth any one but the guilty, whereby it's always ſaid that Sin lyes upon him, <hi>i. e.</hi> the juſt charge of Sin.</p>
            <p>§. 4. Bp. Obj. <hi>But Puniſhment muſt have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sin as to the ſame Perſon.</hi> This is true, it muſt, and always hath; Sin is inſeparable from Puniſhment in the ſame Perſon according to the juſt Terms and Conſtitution of any Law, by which any Perſon is puniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>To this the Bp. ſaith, he anſwers diſtinctly, that there are three ways our Sins are ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſt's Sufferings.</hi> 1. <hi>As an external im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive cauſe no more than occaſional, no proper rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Puniſhment;</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>and ſo for the Socinians.</hi> This I ſuppoſe he leaves to the Socinians, with whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is one in this point. 2. <q>
                  <hi>As an impulſive cauſe becomes meritorious by the voluntary Act of Chriſt's undertaking to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice for our Sins, and not as his own.</hi> 3. <hi>As to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guilt of our Sins.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe three ways of Sin's relation to Chriſt, we will conſider. 1. The fact of Sin, and from it the guilt of it is the proper meritorious cauſe of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41447:16"/>it's <hi>cauſa proegumena,</hi> internal always to the puniſhed, let the Socin. and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſay what they will, the puniſhed is always the guilty Perſon, and he is therefore puniſhed, becauſe guilty. 2. This Impulſive <hi>of ours becomes meritorious;</hi> he ſaith, how I pray? By <hi>Chriſt voluntary underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> &amp;c. This is very abſurd, that Chriſt's free undertaking ſhould make Sin meritorious, was not Sin meritorious of Puniſhment of it ſelf. What is the Sin of faln Angels, that Chriſt never undertook for? But he ſhould have ſaid that Chriſt's volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary undertaking brought the guilt and puniſhment upon himſelf, by his coming under a Law Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for he ſaith, it was to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice; and can Juſtice be ſatisfied by the Sufferings of a Perſon no way guilty in the Eye of Juſtice? That's ſtrange Juſtice. But ſtill ſaith the Bp. <hi>They are conſider'd as our Sins, and not his;</hi> true, our Sins originally, but his by a <hi>Law Tranſmiſſion,</hi> elſe he could not be puniſhed by the Law.</p>
            <p>But now ſee how the Bp. after his brandiſhing by way of Oppoſition, is neceſſitated to fall into rank and file with us. <q>
                  <hi>They are not Chriſt's Sins any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by conſent he took upon himſelf to bear the guilt which relates to Puniſhment, and ſo they come to be juſtly charged upon him.</hi>
               </q> Now I pray what is it that the Bp. ſaith in the winding up of the Matter more than what we ſay; for he ſaith, 1. The Sins were ours, not his originally and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, and the guilt remains in all thoſe for which Chriſt died not. 2. Theſe Sins of all ſaved ones become Chriſt's in the guilt of them, thro' his free and voluntary Intervention. 3. That he took upon himſelf that guilt which relates to puniſhment; <hi>i. e.</hi> its proper law relation. 4. And ſo they come
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41447:16"/>to be juſtly charged upon him; here the Bp hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the whole Point; for, 1. He allows guilt to be diſtinct from Puniſhment; for <hi>Relata are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria affirmantia;</hi> and it's a true notion that guilt and puniſhment are proper <hi>relata conſtantia ex mutua alterius affectione,</hi> and therefore diſtinct. 2. That Chriſt took upon him to bear the guilt that relates to puniſhment; it came not from the Sinner that Chriſt bore the guilt, but from God's Ordination and Chriſt's Submiſſion to law proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and thence wrote <hi>himſelf Debtor</hi> to the Law and Juſtice of God inſtead of Sinners, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as plenary Paymaſter. 3. He owns that Sin came juſtly chargeable on him; the charge of Sin on the Sinner is that whereby he becomes guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. for he that's juſtly puniſhed, is juſtly charged; as he ſaith, <hi>charged upon him,</hi> muſt be in a way of Law proceeding; and tho' God hath made him to confeſs the Truth in Words, yet it fully appears by his after Diſcourſe, that he believes not a word of it in <hi>ſano ſenſu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 3. The third thing, wherein our Sins have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Sufferings of Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>As to the perſonal Guilt of our Sins,</hi> which he denies and decries after he had in the ſame Breath own'd Chriſt's bearing the guilt of our Sins; now he will have Chriſt to bear the guilt of our Sins, but <hi>not the perſonal;</hi> as if there were or could be any guilt that is not of one perſon or another; or if there were ſome generical guilt found in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Perſons; his Exceptions are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The fault of the Sins are not laid on Chriſt.</hi> 1. Then <hi>its Law Relation</hi> was not laid on Chriſt; and Chriſt being puniſhed for no fault of himſelf or others, was unjuſtly puniſhed; nay, he ſaith he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41447:17"/>was <hi>juſtly charged; Is</hi> any juſtly charged, when charged with no fault?</p>
            <p n="2">2. He excepts againſt ſaying that laying Sin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt makes <hi>Chriſt really a Tranſgreſſor;</hi> but how is that ſaid? It is in a legal Senſe, not phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, therefore Chriſt is ſaid to be made Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> Such he was not before, nor was in his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but was really accepted inſtead of the guilty Sinner, not Romantickly and Fabulouſly, the Tranſaction was real, according to the nature of it. As to the denial of Imputation, it's a groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in whoever it is, Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> or Mr. <hi>B.</hi> the firſt miſtakingly denies the ſenſe of the word, but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> denies the thing it ſelf, the very Doctrine of Imputation of Sin to Chriſt, as the Bp. the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt to us, having theſe invective Words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>As the Papiſts have by no means more aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the reformed from them irreconcileably, than by obtruding as an Article of Faith, the Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Contradictions of Tranſubſtantiation; ſo ſome erroneous Proteſtants have no way Men made the Papiſts irreconcileable to us, than by holding forth the Impoſſibilities and Abſurdities of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs, as a moſt neceſſary part of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </q> Meth. Theol. Part iii. Ch. 27. Page 322.</p>
            <p>The great Argument propounded by Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> very unwarily, he not ſeeing how far it would run, but ſufficiently improved by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is this: <hi>That</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>God hath no other Thoughts of things than as they are.</hi>
               </q>—So doth he eſteem and think of things, and conſequently of Sin; in Knowledge we muſt diſtinguiſh between Things and Relation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one Relative and another. God thinks of things as they are under divers reſpects, God thinks
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41447:17"/>and knows what we are by Nature; yea, the moſt eminent Believer is by Nature a Child of Wrath as well as the other; but he knows alſo what he is through Grace, what under a Covenant of Works, and what under a Covenant of Grace; Sinners in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> Righteous in the ſecond. <hi>God calls things that are not, as though they were:</hi> God calls <hi>his</hi> Son <hi>Sin,</hi> in a Law-ſence, who never Sinned; and a Sinner, <hi>Righteous in Chriſt,</hi> who never was Righteous in himſelf: He ſees him as acceptable in his ſight, he having cloathed him with his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as if he were perfectly Righteous in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God knows and ſees all things as he is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, but yet doth not ſee reconciled Ones in their Sins, and Guilt of them, by the Eye of his Juſtice: God ſaw Chriſt under Sin by the Eye of his Juſtice, when he was under the charge of Sin, and his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon abſolutely conſidered moſt pleaſing to him.</p>
            <p>It is no way inconſiſtent with the Nature of God to know what any thing is in its abſolute Being, and what it is in this or that relation; to know a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a Man, and to know him to ſtand under the relation of a Father or a Son; to know what he is Naturally, and what Morally; for this is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Man's knowledge, much leſs with God's; therefore when God knows a thing, what it is in one reſpect, and calls it another; it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he really puts that reſpect or relation upon it; as when God calls a Man a Sinner in reſpect of the Old Covenant, and Righteous in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the New; it is to be ſuppoſed that the ſaid Perſon hath thoſe oppoſite relations really upon him firſt and laſt, and that the ſaid relations are real, and not feigned, in their reſpective way and manner of exiſting. So Chriſt Jeſus in reſpect of Sinners,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41447:18"/>in whoſe ſtead he ſtood relatively, as a Surety, was made truly Sin and Curſe in a Law-ſenſe; reckon'd by God to be really in that Relation, not feignedly; And this is imputation of Sin to Chriſt; which term ought not to be rejected, whoever it is that makes light of it, Dr. <hi>C.</hi> or Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or any other, but moſt excellently expreſſive of the Goſpel My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; as not impoſing any thing on God but what is moſt conſiſtent with his Perfections: For as God can and hath brought his Son under a Law-relation, as a Surety Mediatorial, and as ſuch to ſtand inſtead of Sinners under a charge of Sin, for the Guilt of their Sins; he judgeth as things are, when he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts him, and calls him what he hath made him, Sin and Curſe, in this Law-reſpect, and relation, how pleaſing ſoever his Perſon is to him, being ſingly and abſtractly conſidered from the ſaid rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>§. 6. The Bp. excepts againſt the taking <hi>of the immediate diſcharge of a Sinner, upon Chriſt's bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is eaſie by general and indiſtinct charges to make Men's Opinions look very abſurd, if one Man ſpeak not ſo exactly in a looſe and popular Diſcourſe; are all the Drs. in the World to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as their great Renown to carp at his Words, that are Printed but juſt as taken from him, and not Corrected by him? I think Learned Drs. do much undervalue themſelves in ſo doing. But to the Point in Hand, it is abſurd indeed to ſay that all Sinners have an actual diſcharge in themſelves from the Dominion of the Law immediately upon the Death of Chriſt, moſt being not then in Being in a Natural Senſe, much leſs in a Spiritual. But the Bp. knew well enough the diſtinction of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41447:18"/>Proteſtants, that Redemption is conſidered in Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration and Application; that though the Sacrifice and Propitiation of Chriſt was compleated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in its ſelf, in its Nature, and to all intents and purpoſes, Juſtifying, and Pardoning, and Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace being fully treaſured up therein: Yet this Grace is not Applied, neither can it be Received actually by the Sinner, till, 1. He hath a Being Naturally. And, 2. Till he hath a Spiritual Being, whereto he is Created by the Spirit in Chriſt, and made capable of a Reception by a Spiritual Organ beſtowed on him. 2. He was not ignorant of this Queſtion lately diſputed, <hi>What is the immediate Effect of the Death of Chriſt?</hi> We ſay the great Effects of the Death of Chriſt, are two in General. 1. <hi>A Right to Life in Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>The Application, Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Poſſeſſion of the Life</hi> purchaſed by Chriſt. The 1. <hi>We</hi> ſay is the <hi>immediate Effect</hi> of the Satisfaction and Purchaſe of Chriſt; all Redeemed Ones have a Right in Chriſt, <hi>i. e. latent and hid in Chriſt</hi> and his Fulneſs, even before they are or do Believe; from which Priſtine Fulneſs all received Grace doth flow; even Faith in it ſelf in us. 1. Being in the Soul, and acting on its Object; and thoſe that have this hidden Right <hi>a jus ad rem,</hi> yet they have not preſently <hi>jus in re;</hi> they have not yet received and poſſeſſed the Grace of Juſtification or Sanctification till they Believe through Grace, but are in themſelves under the Law, the Charge and Sentence thereof. This Doctrine I know Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Diſputes with all his might againſt, but was fully Anſwered by Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. Another thing the Bp. Anſwers to, <hi>Is on the Nature of Guilt;</hi> that Guilt of a Sinner is moſt truly <hi>reatus culpae,</hi> and not <hi>reatus penae, reatus
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41447:19"/>culpae,</hi> being that which is accounted Guilt in all Courts of Judicature.</p>
            <p>To which he anſwers, there's a twofold Guilt to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>
                  <hi>Guilt of the Fact, as it is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>
                  <hi>A Guilt conſequent to the Fact by Vertue of the Sanction of the Law.</hi>
               </q> Thoſe which are the Foundation Aſſertions that the Bp. builds all upon, are two. 1. That Guilt which was charged on Chriſt was <hi>reatus penae,</hi> or Obligation to Puniſhment, not <hi>reatus culpae alicujus,</hi> not the Guilt of any Fault, or of any Perſon committing it. 2. He aſſerts that the <hi>Guilt of a Perſonal Fault can never be taken away</hi> by Tranſmiſſion, no, not by Pardon it ſelf: Hence we are neceſſitated to enter the Liſts with him upon theſe two great Points, though ſomething hath been ſaid before concerning them.</p>
            <p>§. 8. We have ſhewed before, that the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is between the <hi>Fact, and Guilt</hi> of the Fact: The Fact is meerly Phyſical, is inherent and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the Agent, not <hi>transferrible</hi> at all, <hi>e. gr.</hi> The Act of borrowing Money is inherent in the borrower, and not a Tranſgreſſion of any Law; but to borrow and not to pay is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law enjoined by commutative Juſtice. Now this is the Guilt of the Fact, when the Fact ſtands as a Fault in the Eye of the Legiſlator by the preceptive part of the Law. 1. The firſt Relations of an irregular Action, is to <hi>the preceptive part of the Law,</hi> being Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. Hence it's a great miſtake to place the Sanction of the Law, only in its Obligation to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; this is but a part of the Sanction conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to its <hi>Obligation to Obedience;</hi> therefore the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41447:19"/>primary guilt of a Sinner lies in Diſobedience, his Fact ſtanding in that Relation to the Law, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes formally the Reaſon why the Sinner is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Puniſhment, he in the ſaid relation of the Fact deſerving it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Bp. is in the right, when he ſaith, <hi>That Obligation to Puniſhment is that which is in the Law, and only the expreſt Will of the Legiſlator;</hi> therefore it can in no true ſenſe be called the Guilt of the Sinner: And hence I muſt needs argue, that the Bp. placing all the Guilt charged upon Chriſt, in the Laws Obligation of him to Puniſhment, doth totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Doctrine of Chriſt's being made Sin for any Sinner: For if he was not made Guilty, but only Puniſhed, he bore only the Law's Obligation, which muſt be only the Sin of the Law, and not of the Sinner. But is the Law Sin? God forbid. Yet this Doctrine plainly makes the Law Sin, becauſe it obligeth a Perſon to Puniſhment who in no ſence deſerves it.</p>
            <p>§. 9. For the overthrowing this Hypotheſis of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Sinner's Guilt of Fact to Jeſus Chriſt, he examines how far guilt is ſeparable from the Act of Sin, <hi>p.</hi> 87.</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. <hi>As to the Guilt of the Fact; for he that hath been an actual tranſgreſſor can never be made not to have been ſo, and ſo the guilt of the Fact muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But methinks a Bp. ſhould not impoſe ſuch a fallacy upon us, that every School-Boy can look through; I ſuppoſe becauſe he lookt upon us as Men very ſhallow, and of no penetration into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For though he that hath been an actual Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor cann't be ſaid not to have been, becauſe it's paſt, and cann't be made otherwiſe than that it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41447:20"/>hath been: Doth it follow from this, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now he is a Tranſgreſſor. His Argument doth run thus, A Man hath been an Actual Tranſgreſſor, therefore now he is, and ever will be; a Man hath been actually Sick or Poor, and therefore he is ſo now, and ever will be. It's a truth unalterable that this or that thing hath been, but it follows not that therefore it's now, and always will be ſo. It is a truth that all the Saints in Heaven have been guilty of Sin, but are they therefore ſo now? Then Heaven is full of guilty Sinners. He alledges the abſurdity of making a <hi>Fact paſt,</hi> not <hi>to be paſt;</hi> there's none aſſerts it; but that the Law may be fully ſatisfied for the obliquity of Fact, we aſſert; and in that ſenſe God is ſaid to take away our tranſgreſſions; for what is the end of Chriſt's ſatisfaction in being a Sin-offering? Is it not to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God in a Law-ſenſe, for the exorbitancy of that Fact; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this obliquity be taken away before God, the Sinner muſt be bound over to Puniſhment: And hence no Fleſh could be ſaved, but all the World muſt remain Guilty, Unjuſtified, and Unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd.</p>
            <p>§. 10. He excepts againſt conſidering Sins as Debts, <hi>which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>when once paid are no</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>longer Debts; but there's difference between the guilt</hi> of a Fact, <hi>and contracting a Debt; for a Debt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a thing real, whoſe property may be altered and transferred, but in criminal matters there's nothing capable of being transferred which is a thing real, but the obliquity and guilt of the Fact, is a privative and perſonal thing.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If Chriſt hath directed us to conſider of Sin as a Debt, ſuch conſideration is moſt regular and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable. 2. If Obedience be that which is due to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41447:20"/>Law of God in the ſtricteſt conſideration of Juſtice, then Diſobedience is a Debt, <hi>erg.</hi> Sin is a Debt. 3. If a Debt be no more a real thing, (but a Privation) then other tranſgreſſions of the Law; then the obliquity may be transferred in one as well as in another; but it is ſo, <hi>Erg.</hi> For a Debt is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Payment, and Privation of it; there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Payment is real. 4. In criminal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters no wrong ſubject is capable to be Puniſhed in a way of Juſtice, but he that is guilty.</p>
            <p>§. 11. He ſaith, the Deſert <hi>of Puniſhment which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the tranſgreſſion, cannot be ſeparated from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That which is meer conſequent to a thing, may be ſeparated from the Eſſential Nature of the thing, at leaſt in Conſideration; but we have ſhewed that the Deſert of Puniſhment is in the formal Nature of Sin: For Sin as ſuch is made by the Law to deſerve Puniſhment, and that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe if the Scripture be true which he ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>Let what Grace or Favour ſoever be ſhewed, the deſert of Puniſhment remains ſtill.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. In Man's Proceedings, a Man that is Pardon'd is taken from deſert of Puniſhment; for it's a ſlander puniſhable to call a Pardon'd Thief a Thief; and the Law is ſilenced from dealing with himas ſuch, or calling him ſo: But here God's ways are not as Man's, when he Pardons he alſo Juſtifies: He provides as well for a full ſatisfaction of his Law, for the very obliquity and exorbitancy of the Fact. But he ſaith a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can't be transferred. <hi>A.</hi> It's, true a Phyſical pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation can't, but a Moral may; and a Debt may by his own Conceſſion; but a Debt is a Privation of the Creditor's Money. I wonder an Eccleſiaſtical Man ſhould not know it as well as others, unleſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41447:21"/>they call Men Debtors that owe them nothing. Again, the B. ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>No Sinner can deſerve that one that was not a Sinner ſhould ſuffer for his faults.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> It is true, no Sinner can deſerve that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer for him, no, nor any ordinary Principal Debtor can deſerve that any Man ſhould be his Surety; but another in kindneſs to him may put himſelf under Obligation to Pay, and Write him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Debtor in his ſtead; ſo tho' Sinners deſerved Puniſhment, yet not that Chriſt ſhould be Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them; and therefore that Chriſt is puniſhed for their Sins, flows from the love of God, and kindneſs of the Lord Jeſus, from which he putting himſelf under Law-Proceedings, and Suffers in a way of Juſtice for Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> taking upon him the Deſerts of Man's Sin. <q>Bp <hi>Nor can the Law, or Act of any Perſon, transfer the deſert of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him that was the actual Tranſgreſſor.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> Here's miſerable Divinity, it's time ſure to come to our Litany, Lord have Mercy upon us. <hi>A.</hi> 1. Cann't a Law transfer a deſerved Puniſhment to another that fully ſatisfies it? Why doth any one fully ſatisfie the Law for another, but that the Law ſhould have nothing to ſay to him, to Charge or Accuſe him; which if ſo, his deſert is taken away. If a Child or Wife commit a great Theft, doth not the Guilt in Law fall on the Father or Husband; and is not the Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deſert taken away by the Father or Husband's ſatisfying the Law. 2. Can no Perſon? Cann't God transfer the Guilt? It's ſtrange that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be ſo miſtaken in ſaying <hi>Jehovah</hi> laid upon him the Iniquities of us all. All the Anſwers to this are ſo frivolous, that they are not worth our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Anſwering them.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41447:21"/>
            <p>§. 12. B. <hi>The Turpitude as to the Act of Sin cann't be re moved from it. A.</hi> All theſe things being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, Sin remains in the beſt, yea, glorified Saints; for Perſonal Guilt remaining and a Turpitude inſeparable, as it muſt needs ſo long as Perſonal Guilt remains, there can be no Sanctified one on Earth or Heaven; for Guilt and Filth is permanent ever, never to be removed according to this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Bp <hi>Where-ever the Act of Sin is, it muſt be diſpleaſing to God, but the Turpitude, as it affects the Perſon of a Sinner, muſt have another conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> Is Sin diſpleaſing to God? And can the Sinner be pleaſing to him ſo long as he lies under the fault of Sin, the deſert and guilt thereof?

I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not how Turpitude of Sin, is diſtinguiſh'd from the Guilt of Sin, the ſaid Guilt being the Turpitude the Law finds, puniſheth for it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it, even in Man's Law: And although Sin carries an inherent Privation of good, and an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pravity; yet there's none of this that hath not perſonal guilt in it which is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>

               <hi>A.</hi> What cauſe can God have to forgive a Sinner, and receive

And this God doth, and yet hates and abhors Sin; for though Chriſt bore Sin, it was not in kindneſs to it, but to condemn it in his Fleſh: And though God loves and ſaves the Perſon of the Sinner, yet he always hated Sin, both of the Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>

Bp <hi>As to the Guilt of Sin, as it relates to Puniſhment, theſe things are to be conſidered.</hi> He ſhould have told us what Guilt of Sin he means, for obligation to Puniſhment, he told us is in the Law, not in the Delinquent, therefore his Guilt is not of Sin, but of the Law. I have not much to ſay to the three particulars, provided they be rightly meant, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>1. <hi>Although a Divine Juſtice require ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for Sin, it is not neceſſary the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Tranſgreſſors ſhould undergo the Puniſhment which they have deſerved.</hi>
               </q> [<hi>i. e.</hi> if another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo their deſerved Puniſhment by a ſubſtitution legally in their ſtead in regard of Deſert and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment] for then there would be no room for Grace and Favour [which is not ſhewed by God to any abſolutely in a diſpenſation, with Juſtice] but in ſuch a <hi>way as may glorifie Divine Juſtice.</hi> 
               <q>2. <hi>That it is conſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God, to accept of a Mediator</hi> [ſuch an one as is a Surety] <hi>to interpoſe between the Severity of the Law, and the Puniſhment of the Tranſgreſſor, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on terms agreeable to Divine Wiſdom and Mercy.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Mediator ought to be between God and Man, in reſpect of Sin eſpecially, the cauſe of Puniſhment; for it's Sin that's contrary to God's Law, Puniſhment of the Sinner is agreeable to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41447:22"/>God's Law. 2. He ſpeaks of terms upon which God accepted of a Mediator; I cannot underſtand what he means by it, for Chriſt's Mediatorſhip was the condition of God's acceptance of us. Chriſt, in reſpect of himſelf, was abſolutely accepted, not upon any previous conditions performed by him, or after-conditions to be performed by us: Which latter I find he intends. <q>3. <hi>That ſuch a Mediator undertaking to make Atonement for our Sins, by Suffering in our ſtead and Place,</hi> [as Sinners] <hi>may truly and properly be ſaid to undergo the Puniſhment of our Sins; and our Sins to be the Meritorious cauſe of it.</hi>
               </q> [By no means in Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering only upon an occaſional remote reaſon from Sin; but he muſt ſuffer judicially, taking upon him a Legal Charge of Merit and Deſert in the place and ſtead of the Sinner.</p>
            <p>Now he ſeems to ſuſpect himſelf in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his to fall upon the Shelves of marvellous inconſiſtency, and therefore indeavours to foreſtall the following Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>If Deſert adhere to Perſonal Guilt,</hi> [inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as before aſſerted] <hi>how can our Sins be the Meritorious cauſe of another's Puniſhment?</hi>
               </q> The Argument againſt his Doctrine he can't Anſwer, for where there's <hi>no Guilt, there's no Deſert;</hi> and where there's <hi>no Deſert, there's no Puniſhment in legal Senſe.</hi> He riggles up and down under the preſſure of this Objection, but can't get it off.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I anſwer, that a meritorious cauſe may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two ways.</hi> 1. <hi>In a Natural Courſe of things; and ſo Deſert follows the Fact, ſo that the Sinner always deſerves Puniſhment, and no interpoſition, nor forgiveneſs, can take off the Deſert,</hi> &amp;c.</q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> The ſubject Act to Sin is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41447:23"/>but the formal Nature of Sin, as Guilt, is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as it ſtands in Relation to the Law: So that ſuppoſing that <hi>Ordine naturae,</hi> the Guilt or Deſert fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Fact, yet it's not in a Phyſical courſe of things. 2. His after Aſſertion implies that no Sin is pardoned in and through the Satisfaction of Chriſt, that whether the Sin be Pardon'd in a way of Grace, or ſatisfied for in a way of Juſtice, the Sin remains in its full ſtrength upon the Sinner for ever; for he that deſerves Puniſhment doth ſo by the Law, for the ſtrength of Sin is the Law, and therefore muſt of neceſſity, for fear of Death, the Wages of Sin, be all the Day long ſubject unto Bondage; this is a ſad Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>As Deſert implies only a juſt reaſon of Puniſhment, and ſo there may be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe in extraordinary Caſes, when the Legiſlator conſents that another bear the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which others have deſerved, Immerito quem<expan>

               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> Here we have the cauſe given. The Queſtion is in plain terms, whether Chriſt Died <hi>merito</hi> for our Sins? He here plainly grants thoſe things, 1. That Deſert implies a juſt reaſon of Puniſhment; then I argue, if Chriſt was puniſhed juſtly, then he Died with a juſt reaſon thereof; and there can be no juſt reaſon of Puniſhment, but Deſert; and if this was on Chriſt, it came from Chriſt's own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Sins, or from ours: The Bp would not ſay from his, therefore from ours. 2. He grants there may be a meritorious Cauſe in extraordinary Caſes, when the Legiſlator conſents that another ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Puniſhment: What's that? 1. Was any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41447:23"/>Caſe more extraordinary than this we are ſpeaking of? 2. He muſt needs mean, that when the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator conſents that another ſhall undergo the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that then the ſaid Perſon ſo undergoing, ſtands under the Deſert of that Perſon for whom he is puniſhed. 3. He grants the truth, and none can deny it, that <hi>Immerito aliquem punire eſt injuſte punire,</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>punire ſine ratione in juditio.</hi> Nothing of Suffering can be reaſonable in Judicial Proceedings, unleſs there be a deſert, therefore he ſaith that <hi>Cic.</hi> puts <hi>jure &amp; merito</hi> together. Now this is the Myſtery that the Bp is to reveal to ſhew how Chriſt was Puniſhed for a meritorious Cauſe, and yet ſtood not under any of our Perſonal Deſerts.</p>
            <p>§. 14. He comes now to Anſwer what is ſaid for Chriſt's bearing our Perſonal Guilt; and the moſt that he ſaith is, to reſay what he ſaid before, and is ſufficiently Anſwered already; but to do him right, we will briefly weigh his ſtrength: The firſt is, <hi>The injuſtice of Puniſhing any</hi> immerito; this is the ſumm of it. His Anſwer lyes chiefly in aſſerting that this is the <hi>Socinian way of Arguing; and ſo we ſee the Antinomians join with the Socinians.</hi> But how the ſame way of Arguing? May not one and the ſame medium be uſed truly and falſly? How is it the ſame way of Arguing? Two Ships may Sail two contrary ways with one and the ſame Wind; but that Anſwer which overthrows the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian, muſt overthrow the Neonom. For the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is true, and will be granted on all hands. The Queſtion between the Socin. and Antinom. is, whether Chriſt Died <hi>merito.</hi> No, ſaith the Socin. becauſe he was an innocent Perſon in himſelf: The Antinom. (as he calls in this, all Calviniſts) ſaith he Died <hi>merito;</hi> not upon the merits of his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41447:24"/>own Sins, but under the merits of ours, in whoſe ſtead he Died: Now comes in the Neonom. and ſays he was puniſhed, but not for any Perſonal Deſert of himſelf or ours. Let the Candid Reader judge now, who is the Socinian; this is enough to ſhew his unfairneſs in this matter; and what he talks after to this matter, is but repeating over and over what hath been brought to the teſt, and found very weak; but tells us ſtill, that what he ſaith is very <hi>agreeable to the Natural Senſe of Men's Minds,</hi> [he ſhould have ſaid to the Natural Man that knows little of the Spirit] <hi>if they would allow themſelves the liberty of thinking;</hi> [yea, of thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of Scripture or any rational Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] and therefore I am aware ſtill that Neon. are the moſt thinking Men in their own conceits in the World, though I find none more abuſive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair in Argumentation.</p>
            <p>§. 15. Bp. But <hi>do we not by this means take away the proper Puniſhment of Chriſt for Sins, and ſo overthrow the Doctrine of Satisfaction. A.</hi> I ſay you certainly do. For, 1. How can you ſay Chriſt was properly Puniſhed, is it for ſuch thinking Men as you are? That any Puniſhment is proper Puniſhment, which is not deſerved Puniſhment. 2. How is it poſſible that you ſay, that that Puniſhment is Satisfactory to God's Law, which is not for the Sins which break the Law. But the Bp ſaith no, ☞ <hi>For I take away nothing but the Puniſhment that follows Perſonal Guilt, and if this be not taken away, the Antinom. Senſe muſt be allowed. A.</hi> Say you ſo, ſtand aſide all Proteſtants, your Houſe is coming down on your Heads: Well, we come upon this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> you muſt either deny
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41447:24"/>that ever Chriſt bore any deſerved Puniſhment, or be Antinom.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to ſee that my late eſteemed Friend Mr. <hi>L.</hi> gave occaſion to ſuch rebukes which he hath received in the Anſwer to his Appeal; that in a fixed Enmity to Dr. <hi>C.</hi> he condemned Chriſt's bearing the Perſonal Guilt of our Sins, as falſe, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and impoſſible; whereas he declares it as the Opinion he contended for, <q>
                  <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt voluntarily, on the Father's invitation, coming under the Sanction of the violated Law, was juſtly charged with the Guilt of our Sin; found Guilty, Condemned, Sentenc'd, and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſuch, even by that God which laid on him the Iniquity of us all.</hi>
               </q> Now the words of the Bp are theſe, <q>
                  <hi>If I do not miſunderſtand, both Dr.</hi> C. <hi>and you, you ſay as much in conſequence as he, — And therefore you cannot diſown the transferring Perſonal Guilt upon Chriſt.</hi>
               </q> This he ſufficiently proves, and I cann't but ſubſcribe to the truth of the Biſhop's Judgment in this matter; for this is a fault and a great inconſiſtency, which I always diſliked, to inveigh againſt ſome as Erroneous, and yet ſaying thoſe very things which they ſpake.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>For as the Bp ſaith, What Guilt of our Sins could be charged on Chriſt; if not the Perſonal Guilt?</hi> &amp;c. See p. 28, 99, 100. <hi>I forbear repeating more in Honour to my Deceaſed Friend.</hi>
               </q> It is good to own and defend truth as truth, without reſpect of Perſons.</p>
            <p>§. 16. The ſecond propoſed by the Biſhop for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That without this tranſlation of Perſonal Guilt, no advantage could come to us by Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41447:25"/>becauſe a Man ſuffers only for his own fault, unleſs the fault of another be laid upon.</hi> The Argument hath great force in it: For, 1. Without tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Guilt upon another, either a guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt Die in his Guilt, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his Sins, or he muſt be abſolutely Pardon'd without ſatisfaction; in both theſe there can be no Benefit by Chriſt's Sufferings. 2. Another Perſon's Sufferings will not profit me, unleſs it be in my room or ſtead, and taken upon that Law-defect that belonged unto me. In Anſwer he ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>Here is no queſtion but our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities were laid on Chriſt, and that he Suffered in our ſtead; but the Diſpute is about the manner how, whether our very Tranſgreſſions themſelves were laid upon him, and how it doth appear that we cann't receive the Benefits of Chriſt's Sufferings, unleſs that were done, which is ſuppos'd to be done. It is a great Argument with them, our Sins are Debts, and they are reckon'd to Chriſt as our Surety: To ſhew how little force there is in it, we need only theſe Conſiderations;</hi> 1. <hi>That there is no ſufficient ground for it in Scripture; as for that of</hi> Iſa. 53.6. <hi>there is not the leaſt ground for it in the Text; for the words properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that he made our Iniquities meet, and to fall upon him,</hi> i. e. <hi>as a Man falls upon his Enemy when he meets him: So the Jewiſh Interpreters.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But doth this Man ſay enough to take off the force of this place of Scripture? 1. He tells us that the meaning is he made our Sins to meet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; the words are here, <hi>Jehovah</hi> made the Iniquities of us all to fall upon him, the word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> what is that but Iniquity? Is it ever taken for Sacrifice for Sin? Who made them to meet? <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> the Legiſlator, God the Judge of all, and how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41447:25"/>can Iniquities of many meet on one Perſon? Can it be any way but judicially? As the Perſon is a Surety, chargeable, and charged with the guilt of many. But ſee what a Sence he would ſham off his Reader with. As a Man falls upon his Enemy when he meets him; he ſhould have ſaid, as many Enemies falls upon a Man when they meet him; for it was the Iniquities of many; but how could our Iniquities fall upon Chriſt to hurt him, if the Guilt of them fell not upon him? And why ſhould <hi>Jehovah</hi> make many Sins fall upon Chriſt? Was there any reaſon for it in Chriſt, or us, or in the Juſtice of God, to ſet ſuch Millions of Maſtiff Dogs on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, on poor innocent Jeſus? Or what Deſign of Wiſdom was it, when thoſe Sins were neither to ſlay Chriſt, nor Chriſt to ſlay them? And this he tells us was the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Symachus</hi> his Interpretation; he knew what Opinion the <hi>Jews</hi> were of concerning Chriſt, and this ſo eminent Propheſie of him; and he might have told us what his Friend <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Opinion was about this place; but he acquaints us how the lxx render, <hi>He gave him up to our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> and is not that againſt him? How could Chriſt be given up to our Iniquities? But in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſerved Puniſhments of our Sins? And <hi>Procopius,</hi> he ſaith, expreſſeth it by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is not this as a Surety? And yet he ſaith here is nothing like Suretiſhip to pay our Debts for us. Now if the Bp. had pleaſed to read out the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he might have ſeen two Verſes more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Truth is litterally expreſs; <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>He ſhall bear their Iniquities,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he ſhall take their Iniquities as a Burden on his Shoulders to carry them away, as the Scape-Goat did the Iniquities of the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And the lxx renders
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41447:26"/>it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, He ſhall take up their Iniquities upon him. And <hi>V.</hi> 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, He ſhall bear the Sin of many; ſhall the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God expreſs it ſelf to one thing ſo fully and plainly, and all fly away at the Puff of a Bp. as Chaff before the Wind? What is all that this learned Bp. hath ſaid to refute this Doctrine of Chriſt's bearing our Sins, and ſatisfying for them as our Debts to Divine Juſtice, but this? Here's <hi>nothing like Chriſt's Suretiſhip to pay our Debts for us,</hi> we will not take his Word for it, till he proves that Sin is not a Debt to the Law of God, when Chriſt hath told us it is. 2. Till he ſhews any other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible way of bearing another's Faults, beſides this way of Suretiſhip; till, 3dly, He ſhews and proves againſt the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> that there is no other way of paying Debts, on purchaſing or redeeming, than with plain Silver and Gold.</p>
            <p>§. 17. He proceeds to ſhew us the <hi>great Harm</hi> of Chriſt's being a Surety to pay our Debts of Sin, <hi>p.</hi> 107. 1. Then Chriſt hath <hi>fully diſcharged our Debts already.</hi> This is one <hi>Miſchief of it,</hi> but God forbid it ſhould that Chriſt ſhould do Harm in paying any Man's Debts; but to do it by halves is to pay ſome only, and leave others for us to pay. How did he ſatisfie God's Juſtice if he gave not full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? God forbid that Chriſt ſhould leave a Farthing for us to pay. 2. <q>
                  <hi>The ſecond Miſchief is, that we have nothing to do towards the Payment of our Debt; all that we have to do is to believe, and to be thankful; for all this Tranſaction was long ſince paſt without Conſideration of any Act on our parts.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> Is it a Harm that Chriſt hath done ſo much for us in way of Satisfaction and Purchaſe? that he hath left nothing of ours to put in for a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41447:26"/>Share in this Honour; no, not our believing it ſelf. I take it to be the Glory of Chriſt, and the bleſſed Priviledge of Believers, that he hath provided for Believers ſuch a Furniture of Grace, that they ſhall believe on him, bear his Image, walk in his Steps, to the Glory of his Name, in all Thankfulneſs, and new Obedience. <q>
                  <hi>The third Miſchief is, that it nulls all Faederal Conditions on our part:</hi> but of this, more afterward.</q> 4. <q>
                  <hi>That we can't ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for thoſe Sins that are already diſcharged.</hi>
               </q> Is this ſuch a Harm? It's neither Reaſon or Juſtice that we ſhould pay a Debt to the Law which is already diſcharged; Chriſt hath born all the Sins of Believers in the deſerved Puniſhments thereof; hence the Sufferings of the Saints are not Penal, nor can be, but are Bleſſings for their Good, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt for them.</p>
            <p>§. 18. The Bp. ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>There's but one place of Scripture to be found to favour this Senſe of the Suretiſhip of Chriſt,</hi> viz. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22.</q> It is eaſie to inſtance in many places that favour it, and prove it, it being, as I may ſay, the very Marrow of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but as to this place, it expreſly calls Chriſt a Surety; and it is the more remarkable, as to our preſent purpoſe, that as the Spirit of God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sins Debts, and Chriſt's Suffering a Price paid, and expreſly excluding Payment by Silver or Gold, ſo Chriſt is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which, as <hi>Lexicog.</hi> ſay, doth primarily ſignifie a Surety for Money. Hence it appears, the Spirit of God makes much of the Metaphor, of Debt and Payment, to confirm our Faith in this, that there's no better account of the Nature of Sin, than a Debt to God's Juſtice; and no better account of the Sufferings of Chriſt, than that they were a Payment of this Debt to the Juſtice
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41447:27"/>of God. And what if it be but in one place of Scripture? When a Truth is ſo fully and plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in one Text, it is enough; there are many Truths of great weight are ſo, beſides the marvellous Concurrence of other texts of Scripture, to the tenor thereof. But he ſaith, this text ſpeaks of a Covenant, not of the Surety of a Covenant. <hi>A.</hi> What is it that makes a Debt is not a Covenant, or compact? But it is of a better Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Surety to pay the Debts of the old Covenant of Works, but brought in by a better Covenant, the new Covenant, being a Covenant of Grace, anſwering the Ends of God's Grace more than the old, doing that which the old could not do to ſave Sinners by a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is not their own, but better, in that it hath a Surety that it brings in to engage unto God to pay all our Debts due to the Juſtice of God from us under the old Covenant, which had no Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. makes it better in nothing elſe but the bringing in a better Hope, <hi>viz.</hi> the Surety. But he poſitively denies that Chriſt was to pay our debts unto God. If ſo, what's the reaſon the Church prays, <hi>Forgive us our Debts,</hi> when God's way of Forgiveneſs of a Sinner, as aſſerted in Scripture, is by bringing in a Surety to pay his debts of Sin, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>In whom we have Redemption thro' his Blood, even the Forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what a Surety is it that he will have Chriſt to be? Sure it is the ſame the <hi>Socinians</hi> will have to be only, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Surety to engage for God to us, not for us to God, but a Surety only for the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God in his Promiſes. See his Words, <hi>p.</hi> 110.</p>
            <p>§. 18. The Bp. takes notice of ſome diſſenting Brethren, (he might better ſaid of Proteſtants diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41447:27"/>from the Church of <hi>Rome, who talk much of Surety, Righteouſneſs, — and of Chriſt's being our Surety as to the Payment of our Debts, becauſe the Debtor may be ſaid to pay the Sum the Surety lays down for him, and that God doth account that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do pay that Debt of Obedience, which Chriſt hath paid in their Stead, becauſe they are a legal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with Chriſt, and all this depends upon this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Notion of Suretiſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is very ſad that ſo plain Scripture ſhould corrupt our Minds with miſtaken Notions, how ſhall we know we are miſtaken or not in any then? Or that we do know the Mind of the Spirit in them, if when we have a plain text, expreſſing a Truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the plain and undeniable Sence of other texts of Scripture, not only agreeing with, but eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Analogy of Faith? If we muſt look on this received Doctrine to be a miſtaken Notion, then ſurely notwithſtanding the Revelation that God hath given us in his Word, he hath left us under Chymerian Darkneſs, and inextricable Laborinths in the great Points of Life and Salvation; but what hath he to ſay againſt this received Doctrine by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren, and all true Proteſtants? <q>
                  <hi>If once it be ſuppoſed that we perfectly obeyed the Law in Chriſt, there can be no room for Remiſſion of Sins; for how can Sins be forgiven to them that have obeyed the Law?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot anſwer this Argument better than in the very Words of Mr. <hi>R. Capel,</hi> (whom none I ſuppoſe will call an Antinom.) in Vindication of Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> on this Point. <q>
                  <hi>There is a double Acception of the Term Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> 1. <hi>There is a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juſtification, or Remiſſion of Sins, this is of Sins before they are committed.</hi> 2. <hi>There's an
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41447:28"/>actual Juſtification or Remiſſion of Sin; and this is not till after our Sin is committed, and we do believe all this, none of theſe Exceptors do or can queſtion. Thoſe that lean much to the Doctrine of</hi> Arminius <hi>and</hi> Vortius <hi>in this point, may ſee all this expreſſed in clear terms by</hi> Vortius. <hi>So that it is one thing for all the Sins of all the Elect to be pardoned to Chriſt for them, that was done before we were, or our Sins were; another thing to be pardoned to them; Chriſt was made a Curſe for us by Imputation; for that the Father did impute all our Sins as a Judge, to Chriſt as a Surety, and did exact all of him as guilty by that Law — and this is (I conceive) all the meaning of Dr.</hi> Twiſs, <hi>and is, or at leaſt ought to be, the meaning of us all; and this a learned Man calls a myſtical Juſtification, becauſe all the Sins of all the Elect are as laid upon Chriſt, ſo remitted unto Chriſt, our Head and Husband; which Pardon and Abſolution he took in our Name, and keeps for our Uſe.</hi>—See <hi>Capel of Repentance,</hi> p. 257, 258.</q> For Brevity-ſake I ſhall add nothing further to the Anſwer of this Argument of the Bp.</p>
            <p>§. 19. He adds, <q>
                  <hi>It doth not follow, becauſe a Debt may be transferred to a Surety; that our Sins may be transferred to Chriſt; and his Reaſons</hi> are, 1. <hi>Becauſe Sins cannot be transferred as Money.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> But doth not the Spirit of God ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently acquaint us, that it's a moral Debt, Sin is the Debt, our owing, and not paying Obedience to the Law; and that Chriſt paid not Silver and Gold, <q>but his Precious Blood;</q> but he ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>That altho' the Sinner be ſaid to owe a Debt to the Law, yet that Debt lyes in an Obligation to Puniſhment, which he is liable to by the Guilt of the Fact.</hi>
               </q>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:41447:28"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Now he owns the Sinner owes a Debt to the Law; but that's not Obedience, but Puniſhment: But believe it, Puniſhment is the Debt of the Law to the Sinner, the Wages of Sin (by the Law) is Death: But that whereby the Sinner becomes a Debtor to the Law, is his Failure, in giving due Obedience to the Preceptive Part of the Law; for its Obedience the Law doth naturally and primarily enjoin and expect from the Subject. <hi>Puniſhment may be transferred by the Legiſlator's Conſent. A.</hi> Puniſhment without Merit is but ſuffering, and not legally inflicted, and can't be done by a Legiſlator without Diſpenſing with his Law.</p>
            <p>Object. <q>
                  <hi>This Debt ariſeth from Guilt of Fact, how then can any diſcharge the Debt, without taking the fault?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>That taking the fault can ſignifie no more than being anſwerable to the Law for it, which muſt reſpect the Debt of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
               </q> Reader, But doth not this quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the Bp. hath been doing? For if Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as always it is) be anſwering the Law for Sin, this always implies that the puniſhed Perſon bears the juſt Demerit of his Sin, elſe why do the Law inflict Puniſhment? It's not becauſe that Man hath not obeyed, but diſobeyed; wherein the Puniſhed is only paſſive in ſuffering, tho' active in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Guilt, wherein lyes the Demerit of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and makes the Wages due from the Law; — <hi>And he that takes away the Guilt of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, doth ſatisfie the Juſtice of the Law. A.</hi> The ſatisfying the Juſtice of the Law lyes in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſerved Puniſhment; for Guilt is not in the Law, as the Bp. hath ſaid, but in a Perſon whom the Law hath found guilty; therefore the Law is not ſatisfied, by afflicting in general, but afflicting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41447:29"/>ſome Perſon that is found guilty and faulty by the Law.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection, <hi>That nothing is the Merit of Puniſhment</hi> but <hi>Reatrus culpae,</hi> he anſwers ſo little, that it's not worth our Cognizance; and that little is but a Rehearſal of what hath been replied to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>§. 20. Bp. <q>
                  <hi>Suppoſe the Fault could be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as a Debt may, how comes it to paſs that upon this Tranſlation there muſt be a preſent Diſcharge?</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> There muſt be ſuch to him that pays the Debt, and this given to him for the Benefit and Uſe of the Priſoner when he will pleaſe to give it. Chriſt muſt be juſtified from our Sins, and diſcharged, or elſe not raiſed from bearing them; when he had ſatisfied Juſtice, all our Sins were pardoned to him; but another Act of Grace is ſhewed, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, and applying Pardon to; and therefore for diſcharging us from the Law as Priſoners of Hope, thro' what Chriſt hath fully done and ſuffered.</p>
            <p>B. <q>
                  <hi>This Doctrine tends to incourage Men to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or careleſs Performance of ſtrict Obedience, which they owe to God.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> This is the Objection againſt the Doctrine of the Grace of God, which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to it made, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. But the Bp. will not take his Anſwer; there he ſaith it <hi>naturally diſpoſeth Men's Minds to a paſſive careleſs Temper, and wait for Supplies from above. A.</hi> The Grace of God never enclines the Heart to ſo ill a Temper, but quite contrary, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. It is one thing, what a Man is by Nature, and what by Grace; Men by Nature are naturally enclined to abuſe the Grace of God, but are not ſo by effectual Grace.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41447:29"/>
            <p>Bp.—<q>
                  <hi>They depend upon Gord's working in them, to will and to do of his own good Pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſetting themſelves to work out their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> The Bp. ſhould have known that the Abuſe of the Grace of God is no juſt Argument againſt it; and if ſome Men do ſo, will he cenſure all as ſuch? God's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Men to will and to do, and their working out their own Salvation, are not Contradictions, if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood; but to ſhew us that the Grace of God is firſt in all we do, that teacheth and worketh in us to work, both to begin and continue to ſerve God with all our Might; but with Fear, leſt we ſhould give the Glory of all unto our ſelves in leaning and depending on our own Strength. The Bp. might have ſpared the reſt of his Banter, it's not worth Paper and Ink to ſpend about it.</p>
            <p>§. 21. He makes a great Clutter againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren, as if in their Doctrine of the Free Grace of God, they <hi>would allow no Conditions upon any Account;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>here is ſomething beyond meer Gratitude and Service, and what's that? It's a Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion in away of Duty, and Means in order to the end, and not meer Connexion in a way of Event ſo that thoſe to whom God will give Glory, he will give Grace to fit Perſons for it. A.</hi> Hereby it's eaſie to ſee what ſtrange Monſters the Oppoſers of the Doctrine of Chriſt do ignorantly or maliciouſly repreſent the Profeſſors and Defenders thereof to be. Do they deny a firm Connexion between Grace and Glory? Do they deny the Neceſſity of Holineſs? Indeed not as <hi>a Faederal Condition of Happineſs, but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of neceſſary Connexion;</hi> and as he gallops along, he is pleaſed to fall upon ſome Expreſſions of mine. Some may perhaps ſay, <hi>What is't but to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41447:30"/>make that Promiſe to ſecure Life upon doing of our Duties? And if this be not to make the Goſpel a more overgrown and ſwinging Covenant of Works, than ever the old Law was, I have loſt, [not they] my Theological Meaſures,</hi> Neonom. <hi>p.</hi> 3, and 296. Reader, Upon theſe few quoted Lines, pick'd up at a diſtance, not truly quoted neither, he makes a large Harangue about Theological Meaſures, (which Words I applied not to any but to my ſelf) and ſay [they] <hi>The Standard of Theological Meaſures is the Scripture.</hi> And ſo I ſay. And ſaith he, St. <hi>Paul was as little ſuſpected of ſetting up a Covenant of Works, as any Penman in the New Teſtament.</hi> I think ſo too. But he hath ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>God hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works,</hi> &amp;c. I ſubſcribe to the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine heartily, and it's expreſly againſt the Bp's Doctrine, who would have our Works the Foederal Condition of the Covenant of Grace, when the Apoſtle ſays, who hath called us not according to our Works; and what is the Genuine Meaning thereof, but that tho' God hath called us to Holineſs, yet it's not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Works, as a Covenant Condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. but it's the manner of theſe Men to quote Places for themſelves, which are Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to them? He makes a needleſs Sput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about working out of our Salvation, and ſaith we are told, Neon. <hi>part</hi> 3. and 296. <hi>No more is meant by this than a continual maintaining a holy Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of our ſelves, leſt we ſhould fail of the Grace of God, by truſting in our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Now doth it become a Bp. to be ſo falſe, in repreſenting what he would expoſe; there's not a word of, <hi>No more is meant by this,</hi> but that this is meant, it may contain more; but this is every Believer's Duty laboriouſly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41447:30"/>to continue in all ways of Holineſs and new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but fear and tremble in Suſpicion of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Heart, which is apt to make his Obedience Hay and Stubble, in aſcribing it to his own Strength, and in making it his Righteouſneſs for his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and if any will rationally argue againſt this Doctrine; I am ready to defend it, as I am other Truths, which I have aſſerted that ſome have ſnarl'd and banter'd at, but have not made any fair ſhew of proving them Errors; and till they do that, I ſhall not honour them ſo far, as to blot Paper about them.</p>
            <p>§. 22. What remains is only to draw odious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences upon this Doctrine of laying our Sins on Chriſt, or his bearing the deſert of Puniſhment for our Sins. 1. <hi>There's nothing for us to do, but only to ſit ſtill, and expect when God will work in us. A.</hi> Doth the Text ſay we muſt <hi>ſit ſtill?</hi> Doth any one ſay ſo? But the Scripture ſaith, and the Saints have practiced, to be continually waiting upon God in the Prayer, and all the means of Grace, to work in them, <hi>to will and to do;</hi> and as God works it in them, he works them to it, knowing that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are not <hi>able to think a good Thought;</hi> but herein being enabled by Divine Aſſiſtance to do a good Work, they muſt keep a Watch over their own Hearts, that they rob not God of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Efficiency, and take it to themſelves. Bp. Paul <hi>gives another Senſe when he perſwades rich Men to do Good,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18. How another Senſe? Doth not the Grace of God perſwade and teach Men to do good Works? Doth not the ſame Apoſtle tell us; that the Grace of God, that brings <hi>Salvation, teach Men to deny Ungodlineſs, and to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>Is laying hold of Eternal Life by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41447:31"/>good Works a ſwingeing Covenant of Works?</hi> No, who ſaid ſo? But there's a twofold laying hold of a thing; one is by way of <hi>Right;</hi> that is, not in our Works themſelves, but in Chriſt; and a laying hold by way of <hi>Participation and Poſſeſſion;</hi> that is, an effect of the Covenant right in Chriſt; and ſo all Believers by the exerciſe of Faith and Holineſs, are continually maintaining their hold of Chriſt and Eternal Life, given them in Chriſt; and the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Meaſure holds here, that <hi>Paul</hi> hath not by this Text thrown down what he taught of the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Grace of God, but only proſecutes that Doctrine; that where it brings Salvation, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Men to do good Works; therefore he exhorts <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to teach by the Word what God's Grace works by the Word and Spirit, neither doth he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelf to rich Men, as if he intended they ſhould be ſaved in a Covenant of Works, which would be no better than Bargain and Sale of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Bp. — <hi>The Foundation of the Covenant it ſelf was certainly nothing but the Grace of God thro' Chriſt. A.</hi> Foundation here's very ambiguous; I know the Neonom. and Papiſts, and all will ſay ſo, when they ſay Chriſt purchaſed the Covenant of Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the new Law, and deny him to be the Condition of it; and therefore he ſpeaks always in their Dialect cunningly; — <hi>yea, and the Foundation of our Hopes as to our obtaining the Benefits. A.</hi> If ſo then, how is Chriſt the Foundation of ſuch Hopes? Is it not Chriſt believed in, as the great Obtainer of Right to Eternal Life, and the great Beſtower of effectual Grace; for without this Faith there can be no Hope, nor any purifying our ſelf, as he is pure.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41447:31"/>
            <p>§. 23.—<hi>Not as Works meritorious of a Reward,</hi> [ſo ſay the Socinians too] <hi>but as Means which God hath appointed in order to an end. A.</hi> I pray who denies all this of the Calveniſts? All which he calls Antin. but doth he not trip up his own Heels by this Conceſſion? I ſay, and I am ſure can prove, that the Condition of a Covenant compact, let the thing required be little or more, it's meritorious of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Reward promiſed, and is <hi>meritum expacto;</hi> now then if he concede that our Works are not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of a Reward, he gives us all we contend for, provided he yeild that the Condition of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant compact is meritorious of the Reward, which all Men of Senſe will acknowledge; well then, what Place [after all this noiſe] is Works to have? He ſaith, <hi>They are only Means which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in order to an end. A.</hi> If this be rightly meant, we will grant it, and yet hold our Aſſertion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd; for tho' all Foederal Conditions are Means, yet all Means are not Covenant Conditions; antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent things are Means of coming to conſequent, but not always Foederal Conditions. Now if he will ſay eternal Life is that end, I will ſay more, that he hath not Eternal Life who hath not ſuch a Faith, which hath its Fruits unto Holineſs; and that this Holy Life belongs to, and is that Eternal Life begun in us. Bp. <hi>As a Son that hath an Eſtate promiſed him of the free Gift of his Father, but yet he requires ſome Conditions to be performed by him before he comes to the Poſſeſſion of it; can any one think this to be Bargain and Sale between Father and Son.</hi> A. <hi>The Compariſon is too ſhort to illuſtrate, much leſs to prove the thing.</hi> For, 1. In this the Father will not enjoin any Conditions but ſuch as the Son hath Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to perform. As for Example; He will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41447:32"/>a poor lame Cripple to leap over a Hedge firſt, nor a Stone-blind illiterate Son to read a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Hebrew Bible. Now to ſay that our Caſe runs parallel, it's falſe; for if God promiſe Eternal Life upon the condition of our good Works, who are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, it's to do it on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performable condition; which becometh not the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. 2. And he ſaith, <hi>Can any one think this to be Bargain and Sale? A.</hi> Yes ſure, there are ſuch Fools in the World. If all be ſo who believe not as the Bp. ſaith, I would ask the Bp. if his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould tell him, Child, if thou wilt reſign up thy Biſhoprick of <hi>Worceſter</hi> to thy Brother, I will give thee the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> would not the Bp. demand the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> as due to him from his Father upon his Reſignation, let the Father be <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the King, or any other?</p>
            <p>§. 24. Now he ſaith, <hi>If theſe be Theological Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they had need to ſeek for new ones.</hi> No ſure, for the Bp. hath ſaved us that Labour, he hath found them for us; but ſuch as are but Traſh by the Standard of Scripture and Reaſon. Now he reckons he hath paid off Theological Meaſures, but faith, he hath not yet done with them. <hi>Sure we may moſt ſafely take our Theological Meaſures from our Saviour,</hi> [yes ſurely, there's no doubt of it] <hi>for he knew beſt how far, and in what Senſe the Guilt of our Sins was transferred upon him, and whether there followed an immediate Diſcharge upon it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to Conditions on our parts; the Queſtion of the higheſt Import being put to him, what ſhall I do to inherit Eternal Life? A.</hi> Where lyes the Force of this Argument? It muſt be here: If Chriſt had this Queſtion twice put to him, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit Eternal Life?</hi> And his Anſwer was, <hi>Keep
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41447:32"/>the Commandments, and thou ſhalt live;</hi> then the Guilt of our Sins were not laid on Chriſt <hi>[non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur]</hi> ſo he ſaith, as to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.25, 28. <hi>Had our Saviour only a mind to banter him?</hi> No, what was it then? He himſelf tells us, <hi>It was to convince him of the Impoſſibility of his doing what was neceſſary for Eternal Life.</hi> He ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the Covenant of Works; and therefore of performing a Covenant Condition anſwerable to the Covenant of Works, whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> expected a merited Reward, they ſought Life by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law; and he acknowledgeth, <hi>That it is not improbable that our Lord intended to convince him of his Folly, who ſuppoſeth he had kept thoſe Commandments in the Jewiſh Sence of them.</hi> And this is the true meaning of the Text, why therefore is this Text brought to prove that Chriſt bore not the Guilt of Sins? <hi>Baculus ſtat in Angulo ergo pluit.</hi> There's as iittle conſequence from the other, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.17. The ſame or like Anſwer may ſerve, which he ſuggeſts himſelf. <hi>There was an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Love to the World in his Heart, which he was not aware of till our Saviour put him upon a ſevere Trial of himſelf, Go ſell what thou haſt,</hi> &amp;c. Upon this Trial he ſhewed himſelf, and went away ſorrowful, notwithſtanding all his ſeeming Deſire for Heaven, this was the true Reaſon, and no other; and Chriſt intended not thereby to eſtabliſh a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; and what he ſaith after is to little purpoſe; it's only to wreſt the Senſe of a Text from what he thought in his Conſcience it would bear. And ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9. <hi>Make to your ſelf Friends of the Mammon.</hi> What, doth he ſay of that? <hi>Not by way of Merit, or any fooliſh Imagination of that ſort, but in Obedience to the Will of God, who hath
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41447:33"/>made it a neceſſary Duty.</hi> Do they ſpeak otherwiſe who hold Chriſt bore their Perſonal Guilt? I wonder a Bp. ſhould trifle ſo ſhamefully. Again, he ſaith, <hi>If theſe be Theological Meaſures, what doth our Saviour mean,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A.</hi> He means, not that he did not bear the Guilt of Sin, or any ſhould ſtrive in his own Strength, or ſtrive as a Foederal Condition; for he ſaith, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall ſtrive, [i. e.</hi> falſly in ſuch a manner,] <hi>and ſhall not be able;</hi> and who interprets ſtriving here, of faint and weak Endeavours? Certainly he would render all them that holds that Chriſt bore the Guilt of Sin to be a pitiful ſort of Chriſtians, that have little or no regard to the Command of Chriſt. Sure, if they were ſo, they would not many of them ſo joyfully have ſuffered the ſpoiling of their Goods by the Biſhops in the late time of Perſecution; and what led them to it but a Conſcience of Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>He ſaith, One would think it impoſſible to enter into a Man's Head, to ſuppoſe that <hi>a Man's own Righteouſneſs ſhould be excluded from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, if he look to</hi> V. 21, and 24. <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt doth not in the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Man's Righteouſneſs to his, nor make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with his, but gives only a Character of ſuch as be ſincere Believers and Profeſſors of his Name, and will be found ſo at the laſt Day.</p>
            <p>What he ſays of immediate Diſcharge hath been ſpoken to before, that the immediate Effect of Chriſt's Death was a Right to a Diſcharge; the Diſcharge it ſelf could not be before they have a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Spiritual Being.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41447:33"/>
            <p>§. 25. Bp. If there be <hi>no condition, how can they be ſatisfied that the Guilt of their Sins are laid on Chriſt? A.</hi> In anſwer to this it's ſaid, believe with all thy Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that muſt be a real receiving of Chriſt: He that hath the Son hath Life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12. The Sinner firſt receives Chriſt, after ſees and knows he hath received Chriſt himſelf, V. 13, and 20. And we own there may be preſumption, where there's an appearance of believing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, only there need not be ſuch ſputter as he makes about theſe matters, neither doth it profit his cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>while we were Sinners Chriſt Died for us;</hi> ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: Two things thereby ſignified, 1. That Chriſt Died for us under that Conſideration, for he came not to Save thoſe that are Righteous, but thoſe that were Sinners. 2. That it was long ago that Chriſt Died while we were in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and in an unregenerate ſtate, Sinners of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; to which he rejoins thus, <hi>How then muſt every Sinner believe that Chriſt Died for him? A.</hi> Every Sinner under the Call of the Goſpel, is to believe in Chriſt for Life and Salvation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conſtant tenor of the Goſpel; but to know Chriſt did bear his Sins, and die for him, reſults from this Believing. He that hath the Son, <hi>i. e.</hi> by believing, hath Life. Receiving is firſt before knowing that a Man hath Received; and it is Goſpel truth, that Chriſt bore the Sins of every one that truly believes; and every one is an Elect Perſon, whoſe Sins Chriſt bore: For if the Apoſtle ſpake true, he that makes ſure his Calling, makes ſure his Election. — <hi>Then ſaith the Bp. here is Univerſal Redemption aſſerted in its full extent; and what is more, here is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41447:34"/>Election too; if all Men can believe that their Sins are forgiven. A.</hi> Let us examine the Bp's fallacious Arguing. 1. The Goſpel is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely preached to all under the Call thereof, and directed to all Sinners without any exception; he that believes on the Lord Jeſus, ſhall be ſaved; is this an Argument that Redemption is Univerſal, or that all are Saved, or Elected: It's ſaid as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as were Ordained unto Life believed, therefore it cann't be ſaid that every one doth or can believe, <hi>John</hi> 12.39. 2. See how foully this Man impoſeth by charging his oppoſites with ſaying, <hi>That all Men can believe that their Sins are forgiven,</hi> p. 133. or to charge this, as <hi>p.</hi> 132. <hi>That a Man's Sins are forgiven becauſe he believes that they are forgiven, being laid on Chriſt;</hi> whereas a Man believes becauſe his Sins are forgiven and laid on Chriſt; for Chriſt bearing our Sin is the Cauſe of believing, and not the Effect. — <hi>At leaſt conditional Election follows upon it he ſaith.</hi> We ſee he ſuſpected his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and therefore poacheth in another. This may ſerve for a Profeſſed Armin. but the Bp. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe would not have been accounted ſo; the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, becauſe Men are Saved in and by believing on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, therefore Election is upon foreſight of Faith; but we ſay Men are as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Elected unto Faith as unto Glory: The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of Conditional Election is not here to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon, but we aſſert that it follows more upon the Bp's Hypotheſis than ours.</p>
            <p>§. 26. <hi>He adds, its ground enough of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to all ſuch as can believe that their Sins are forgiven. A.</hi> Thoſe that can believe their Sins are forgiven, can believe through the Grace of God working it; nay, they have attained to a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41447:34"/>of Grace; How doth preſumption conſiſt with, <hi>can Believe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>B. <hi>What can hinder any Man more from Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and forſaking his Sins, than to be told that the firſt Act of Saving Faith, is to believe his Sins is forgiven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> Where is any one that will teach an Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to Believe his Sins are forgiven in the ſtate of Unbelief? But we find the Voice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the Unbeliever, is to invite and call him to believe the Goſpel; which ſaith, that this is a Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthy of all acceptation, That Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners; that he bore Man's Sin, and was made Sin and Curſe for them, and that the Sinner ſhould come in particular and apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chriſt for this Pardon and Forgiveneſs that is in Chriſt; for with him is Pardon and Plentiful Redemption. He is a Fountain opened for Sin and Uncleanneſs, and if a Fountain, then not an empty Object of Faith, but full of Pardon, and of all the Grounds and Reaſons of a Sinner's Faith and Hope. Now how doth ſuch coming to Chriſt, and cloſing with him in a free Promiſe, hinder Repentance, and embolden them unto Sin? For the Apoſtle ſaith, Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you, becauſe you are under the Grace of God in the Promiſe; and he ſhews Sin will reign over a Man while he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</p>
            <p>— <hi>But the Goſpel Preacheth Repentance in order to Remiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> It Preacheth Repentance and Remiſſion, to ſhew, that where there is Repentance to Life there is Remiſſion; and where there is Remiſſion receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith, there will be Repentance in a Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, coming to God through Chriſt. The Soul cann't turn from Sin to God, but by a believing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41447:35"/>Repentance, neither can any Repentance be unto Life, unleſs it be a turning from Sin to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt. Hence Faith and Repentance are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put for one another, or in one the other included. When the Scripture ſpeaks of the firſt Act of the Sinners coming unto God, yea, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt act of true Faith, but all other are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from Repentance, as from other Graces, Love, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though both Repentance, Love, and Hope, are diſtinct Graces and Fruits of the Spirit from Faith, and from each other. This, laſtly, I affirm, as the truth of the Goſpel, that there can be no true Repentance antecedent in Nature to true Faith, Faith being the firſt effect of Spiritual Life in one that is effectually called. Bp <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is commanded, and Baptiſm commanded, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are conditions. R.</hi> The Antecedent is true, but the conſequence follows not, if he meant new Covenant Conditions. For all things, and Duties Commanded are not therefore foederal Conditions: For that Grace which God works by his Word and Spirit, is very abſurdly called a Condition of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that God makes with a Sinner. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, he makes Repentance ſuch a condition as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; if ſo, what inſeparable connection is there (as there ſhould be in this Caſe) between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and promiſe; for will any ſay that he that is not Baptized ſhall be Damn'd? The Scripture ſaith not ſo, beſides the Seal of a Bond is not the Condition of the Obligation, but only a Ratification.</p>

                  <hi>Whether Mr.</hi> R. B. <hi>did Socinianize.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The Chief thing diſcuſſed by the Bp in his third Chapter, is whether Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was a Socinian, from which Charge he makes as if he would Vindicate him; I ſhall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41447:35"/>briefly examine how he acquits himſelf in this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult undertaking. The ſum and ſubſtance of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Opinion in this Point was, <hi>That our Sins were no proper meritorious Cauſe of Chriſt's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, they were only premeritorious or occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſes.</hi> For although the Bp would have Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mean ſomething more than occaſional, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritorious, yet he acquits us with Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own Explication of his meaning of premeritorious, that it is only occaſional, which the Bp ſaith is no cauſe at all, and Socinianiſm; and yet he, good Man, would defend him, though he finds it <hi>hic labor hoc opus,</hi> and fain to leave it <hi>re infecta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt proof which he would make is from Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Confeſſion, wherein all that he ſaith is no more than what a Socinian will ſay in this Point, <hi>That Chriſt gave up himſelf a Sacrifice for our Sins, and a Ranſom for us, in ſuffering for us upon the Croſs;</hi> which he doth make (according to his way of moulding of Doctrine) comport well enough with Socinian Principles. See what he gives for Antinomianiſm. 1. <hi>That Chriſt ſatisfied God's Juſtice as in the Perſon of all the Elect,</hi> this one Error, whereby he denies Jeſus Chriſt to be <hi>a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Perſon.</hi> 2. <hi>That in a Law-ſence, and God's account, they themſelves did ſatisfie in and by Chriſt.</hi> Here he denies Chriſt to have Suffered in our ſtead, or to have made Payment to Juſtice for our Sins, either in a Law-ſenſe, nor in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and therefore he made no payment for us, neither <hi>can we ſay we ſatisfie in and by him:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every Debtor can ſay ſo, who hath a Surety that makes payment in his ſtead, the Law accounting this payment to the Original Debtor; neither is it untrue that he paid in and by his Surety, but an
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41447:36"/>honour to his Surety, and detraction from himſelf, when he ſaith he paid in and by his Surety. 3. <hi>That Chriſt's Sufferings were full and proper Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the threatning of the Law to Man.</hi> Here he denies Chriſt's Suffering under the Law that Man brake; and that his Puniſhment was no proper execution of the threatning of the Law, and therefore no proper Puniſhment. 4. <hi>And ſo acquits them</hi> ipſo facto <hi>on the meer Suffering.</hi> Here he makes up his charge by ambiguous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions — <hi>without any further means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to give them right in it by Application.</hi> 1. Here he inſinuates that there was no Diſcharge of Chriſt from the Sins of the Elect, which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for: If ſo, no ſatisfaction. 2. He makes as if ſome held that Men have an Actual and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal diſcharge, before their <hi>being</hi> by Grace or Nature; which is a falſe Charge, and a male Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent drawn by himſelf on the Doctrine: As if thoſe that held Chriſt's full and compleat Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by impetration, denied application. 3. He would have us believe it an Error that Chriſt purchaſed a right to Eternal Life for all the Elect, as the immediate effect of his purchaſe; and that our right comes by application, whereas our right lyes in the purchaſe only; and our claim of that right and poſſeſſion is by application.</p>
               <p>The Socin. Error he thus repreſents, <hi>That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did not undergo any Penalty for our Sins, as meritorious, or promeritorious Cauſe, but only as occaſional:</hi> And doth not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſay the ſame thing again and again in his Writings, only he foacheth in his promeritorious; which if the Socin. either did not uſe, or if they did, they would not deny it in the Senſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> uſeth it, and as he hath explain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41447:36"/>
                  <hi>And that he did not make any Satisfaction to God's Juſtice for us,</hi> &amp;c. there is nothing plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Writings; both in his <hi>Methodus</hi> and <hi>Univerſal Redemption.</hi> He puts for Truth as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt as a Publick Sponſor, did bear the Puniſhment deſerved by the Sins of the World,</hi> [he means of all and every Man] <hi>and made to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Satisfaction ſufficient for all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſtrange a Biſhop of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould look upon this as an Orthodox and Plain Confeſſion to diſtinguiſh a Man from a Socinian; for it's plain he prevaricates in ſpeaking of Chriſt as a Publick Perſon, for in the Antin. charge, he makes it a marvelous Error to ſay Chriſt ſatisfied Juſtice in the Perſon of all the Elect, ſo he muſt mean here, that Chriſt was ſuch a Publick Perſon, that was no Repreſentative or Surety, which is no publick Perſon at all. 2. In that he ſaith Chriſt did <hi>bear the Puniſhment deſerved by Sin,</hi> he alſo prevaricates, for he doth every-where deny that our Sins were imputed to Chriſt; that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Puniſhment of our Sins in any proper Senſe, and that Sin was but an occaſional, no proper Cauſe thereof, and therefore his Puniſhment was but Analogical, Equivalent to the Socinian's Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical. He cann't mean in reſpect of proportion in a Mathematical Senſe, for that would overthrow his whole Hypotheſis.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> quotes enough to overthrow all that the Bp pleads on his behalf: He ſhews that in his <hi>Methodus,</hi> he expreſly declares <hi>that the Sufferings of Chriſt were only a Natural Evil undergone by occaſion, and the remote cauſality of the Sins of Mankind, — and that Chriſt's ſufferings are only
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41447:37"/>ſufferings in an Improper and Analogical Senſe.</hi> Theſe things ſaith, the Bp, were long ſince written. The chief Expreſſion is, Chriſt's Sufferings had no proper meritorious Cauſe, but yet Man's Sins were the <hi>Pro cauſa meritoria,</hi> &amp;c. and ſaith nothing to defend it, <hi>p.</hi> 151. He conſiders <hi>whether Mr.</hi> B's <hi>own words do lay him open to the ſuſpicion of going too far towards the Socinians in this matter.</hi> Now let us ſee whether Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath a fair delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at the Bp's Bar.</p>
               <p>Bp <hi>In this caſe we muſt diſtinguiſh the Scripture Notion of Puniſhment from a Strict and Philoſophical Senſe of Puniſhment. R.</hi> This is a ſtrange diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Learned Bp; what means he by a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Puniſhment? Is it morally Philoſophical, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch Puniſhment as belongs to the breach of a Moral Law? If ſo, ſure the Scripture Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cann't be diſtinguiſhed from it; for that is legal Puniſhment; but he ſaith it's ſtrict Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the exact tenor of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; if he mean ſo, it cannot be excluded from Scripture Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Bp <hi>The Scripture ſpeaks in General of Chriſt's bearing our Sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but not a word of ſtrict and proper Puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> No ſure, the Bp is miſtaken greatly, when he might ſee in the ſame Chapter that Chriſt was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, was not that proper Puniſhment? Doth the Scripture ſay nothing of ſtrict and proper Puniſhment, when it ſaith the <hi>Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law? Is not the Curſe of the Law ſtrict and proper Puniſhment? If this be his Philoſophical Puniſhment, there's much of it in Scripture, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41447:37"/>it cann't be diſtinguiſh'd from it. Bp. <hi>But of that which was appointed and accepted in order to atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our Sins, as the impulſive Cauſe, which become meritorious by his voluntary undertaking. R.</hi> The Bp would ſuggeſt that there's ſome general improper acceptation of Puniſhment in Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſed, in which ſence Chriſt was Puniſhed; becauſe he ſaith the nature of the Expreſſions, that is, of the uſe of the word Puniſhment, doth imply as it were an impulſive cauſe; when indeed there was none but ſomething that God appointed and accepred in order to Atonement, but was not Puniſhment in ſtrict and proper Senſe. <hi>But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes meritorious by his voluntary undertaking. R.</hi> That is as much as to ſay, there was nothing in Chriſt's Sufferings themſelves, that made them Meritorious, but ſomething Antecedent to them, <hi>viz.</hi> The Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in giving himſelf to be a ranſom, but the ranſom it ſelf and what he ſuffered had no merit in it. Here the Bp doth baſely <hi>Baxterize</hi> to caſt Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> in this Cauſe. To which I briefly return, that Puniſhment which was appointed by God, and accepted for full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his offended Juſtice, was ſtrict and proper Puniſhment, and of it ſelf meritorious, but Chriſt's Puniſhment was ſuch. The Major is true, elſe the Judge of all the World did not deal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, in putting his Son to grief; for if he put him not to as much as the Law required, the Law was not ſatisfied; if he made only a ſhew of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him, and did not do it, then the Scripture hath given us but a kind of Romantick account of Chriſt's Puniſhment, when indeed there was no ſuch thing, nor any ſuch cauſe as the Scripture acquaints us with.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41447:38"/>
               <p>He acquaints us that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> not content with Scripture terms, falls to enquire into the Nature and Reaſon of the thing it ſelf, ſuggeſting that he would dive deeper into the thing than Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Puniſhment is a Natural Evil inflicted for a Moral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Name of Puniſhment is ambiguous, becauſe it relates to Puniſhment juſtly inflicted, and that which is not; the former Proper, the latter Analogical.</hi> So that this Analogical Puniſhment is that which hath a repreſentation, and looks like it; but is not ſo, <hi>Similia non ſunt Idem;</hi> things alike are not the ſame. And that which is improper is unjuſtly inflicted, <hi>ergo;</hi> and hence, Chriſt's Sufferings would be unjuſt. But he ſaith, the firſt and <hi>moſt natural Senſe of puniſhment, is when the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuffers for his own fault; but there may be other reaſons of Puniſhment which he calls Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and thoſe from nearneſs of Relation, as Subjects for Princes, or Vicarious;</hi> and why I pray muſt theſe be called Analogical and Improper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Becauſe it's Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s pleaſure: Why would it not be better diſtributed, (unleſs to ſerve a turn). Puniſhment is either juſt or unjuſt: Juſt, is either that which falls on the Perſon committing the fault, or on another Relation, or Sponſor that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers on his behalf, voluntarily ſubjecting to the Law in his Place; and what need we Analogical, when Proper payment is made to the Law? Bp <hi>From whence he inferrs, that ſince Chriſt did not Die as a Sinner, therefore his Puniſhment could not be proper in the ſtricteſt ſenſe. R.</hi> But if Chriſt Died for Sin, he Died as Sinners Die; though he did no Sin, and in that ſenſe was not a Sinner; yet he Died for our Sins, as the reaſon of judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41447:38"/>againſt him; and this being done by a juſt God, for the honour of his Law, it could not be but proper Puniſhment: For all juſt Puniſhment is proper Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The Bp himſelf ſhews, that this will not hold Water; for whereas Mr. <hi>B. diſtinguiſheth of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by falſe imputation, and calls it unjuſt, but Analogical; and the Puniſhment of another by conſent he calls Analogical, but not unjuſt,</hi> the Bp Anſwers, <hi>If the Puniſhment be juſt, the Cauſe muſt be juſt; and Chriſt's could not be juſt with Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his own fault, for none is ſuppoſed; therefore there may be a juſt Puniſhment for another's fault; and if ſo, that</hi> [viz. <hi>the fault of another] may be truly ſaid to be the Meritorious cauſe of it, and the Puniſhment a proper Puniſhment, although for another's fault.</hi> What can be ſaid more directly and demonſtratively againſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in this Point? The Argument is this.</p>
               <p>That Puniſhment which is juſt, muſt have a juſt cauſe of fault, either in the Perſon ſuffering, or ſome other; and that cauſe is truly meritorious, and the Puniſhment a proper Puniſhment. But the Puniſhment of Chriſt was ſuch, therefore a proper Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Having thus thrown Mr. <hi>B.</hi> on his Back, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make ſome little excuſes for him; <hi>That which led Mr.</hi> B. <hi>in denying of it, was the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians making Chriſt to undergo the proper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Sin, becauſe our Perſonal Guilt was according to them transferred upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Hence it appears, that in the Bp's Judgment, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was more excuſeable in being a Socinian, than in being an Antinomian; <hi>for he finding,</hi> (ſaith the Bp) <hi>this Principle to be the Foundation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinom.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41447:39"/>that this could not be true, and therefore denied Chriſt's Puniſhment to be proper.</hi> But let me ſpeak what is truth, as to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that I believe he had a further inſight into this Controverſie than it appears the Biſhop had; and would have told him, that theſe two Principles are inconſiſtent, and overthrow one another; <hi>Chriſt's Suffering was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Puniſhment.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt bore no Perſonal guilt of any;</hi> ſo that the Bp's Argument that refutes Mr. <hi>B.</hi> redounds back upon himſelf. So that inſtead of fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off Mr. <hi>B.</hi> they both fall irrecoverably together by one blow; and it's eaſie to take notice how he buffets Mr. <hi>B.</hi> afterwards, quoting Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s words upon this reaſon; he ſaith, <hi>But then as you (Mr.</hi> Lob) <hi>truly cite his words, he makes our Sins not to be the meritorious Cauſe of Chriſt's Sufferings, but a kind of promeritorious or occaſional Cauſe.</hi> Therefore he means no more by promeritorious than occaſional; and in the Bp's Judgment falls under Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Charge. Yea, he ſaith <hi>we muſt do him right,</hi> [is it to acquit or condemn Mr. <hi>B?</hi> Sure to paſs ſentence againſt him,] <hi>So far as to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in ſtating the Socinian Controverſie, he makes it to conſiſt in denying that Chriſt did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go any Penalty for our Sins, as the meritorious or promeritorious Cauſe, but only as occaſions; and yet here he makes the pro-meritorious cauſe and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional the ſame; and he denies that our Sins were the meritorious cauſe; but only becauſe if we had not Sinned he had not ſuffered.</hi> What is this any more, than an occaſional cauſe? If the World had not been created, Man had not fell; if there had been no Law, there had been no Sin; and what ſaith the Bp, truly he is neceſſitated to give Sentence againſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> though in as ſoft terms as may be.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41447:39"/>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 156. <hi>Theſe Expreſſions, I grant, taken alone, yield too much to the Socinians, who do not deny our Sins to have been a remote impulſive and occaſional cauſe of Chriſt's Sufferings, but deny them to be the meritorious cauſe of them.</hi> What can be more plain and full to prove Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Socinianizing in theſe Points?</p>
               <p>For all this, he will <hi>not give up</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians; why? Becauſe he hath writ of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity; that he might do, and yet be a Socin. in the Doctrine of Satisfaction: But he hath written of the Doctrine of Satisfaction; yes, he hath retained the word to make his Doctrine go down the better, but hath endeavoured to deſtroy the thing to all intents and purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Bp. <hi>Theſe may be ſaid for his Vindication,</hi> 1. <hi>By laying all the paſſages together, he muſt mean ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more by his promeritous Cauſe, than meerly a remote occaſional Cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This ſuppoſition is very unreaſonable when the Bp hath told us, from Mr <hi>B</hi>'s own Mouth, what he means by his promeritorious Cauſe. It is not hard to conceive what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> meant by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritorious, it is only that Sin Antecedently to Chriſt's Death was meritorious of Death; but this merit terminated there, and never reached as a Cauſe meritorious of the Sufferings of Chriſt: <hi>This merit the Bp ſaith is antecedent to the Legiſlator's act in accepting a Sponſor, and is but an occaſional Cauſe; and what ſaith he of an occaſional Cauſe? It's really no Cauſe at all,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>juſt as if a Man ſaid, the Fire of</hi> London <hi>was the occaſional Cauſe of the Monument,</hi> p. 169.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:41447:40"/>
               <p>Bp. <hi>Now no Man can ſay the fault antecedently was any more than an occaſional cauſe of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſon's Suffering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is true in Mr <hi>B</hi>'s ſenſe, that the fault of the Offender makes him only guilty and deſerving of Puniſhment in general; but is not transferred to the Sponſor to be any Guilt or deſert of his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is truly Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s meaning of his term promeritorious: And therein Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is conſonant to himſelf, in ſaying it's but an occaſional Cauſe, and that Sin is a remote impulſive Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Chriſt, tho' immediate and impulſive to Puniſhment. 2. This is true in the Bp's Senſe, who ſaith, Chriſt ſuffered Puniſhment for Sin, and bear the Perſonal Guilt of none, is to make the Sin of Man no more than an occaſional Cauſe: But the conſiſtency of the aſſertion lyes more on Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s ſide, becauſe he knew it to be a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency to ſay, that Chriſt bore proper Puniſhment, when he bore the guilt of no Sin.</p>
               <p>Bp. <hi>But taking all together, when he is admitted to ſuffer in the place of the Guilty, the Law with the Puniſhment makes the impulſive Cauſe become meritorious; and it is the immediate Reaſon of his Sufferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> This the Bp ſpeaks as the truth, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates as if he would have it Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Senſe, but gives no proof that it is ſo; neither is it likely he ſhould, being not conſonant at all to what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> every-where maintains; and what if the Bp ſaith ſo, it's not conſonant at all to the Tenet he defends that Chriſt bore no Perſonal Guilt? For then how can the Guilt of any become the meritorious and immediate reaſon of his Sufferings?</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:41447:40"/>
               <p>Bp. <hi>The only queſtion then is, whether this can properly be called a meritorious cauſe.</hi> A. <hi>That may be taken in two Senſes.</hi> 1. <hi>In a ſtrict and proper ſence; ſo your ſelf deny that Chriſt merited by his own Sin.</hi> 2. <hi>In the ſenſe of the Law, [i. e.</hi> Sin was legally charged on Chriſt] <hi>and ſo that which was the near impulſive cauſe</hi> [the fault of the Tranſgreſſor] <hi>may be truly ſaid to be meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to his ſufferings, becauſe they made it an act of Juſtice, which otherways had been an act of Power and Dominion. R.</hi> See now the Bp's clear conceſſion. 1. That what is here ſpoken of Chriſt, it's in the ſenſe of the Law, not in a Phyſical or Moral ſenſe. 2. He makes the near impulſive cauſe Sin, and here Sin in its merits or deſerts, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reaſon of Chriſt's ſuffering; can that be any thing but the Guilt of Men's Perſons? 3. Sin is ſuch a reaſon as may diſtinguiſh Chriſt's Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from an Act of Dominion, and make it an Act of Juſtice. How is it poſſible that any Man that ſaith this, can ſay that the guilt of Man's Sin was not charged on Chriſt as our Repreſentative in a legal Senſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a way of Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</p>
               <p>Now doth the Bp lay down this as Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s ſenſe? No, he dare not; for if he did, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (were he living) would ſay he had laid therein the Foundation of Antinomianiſm.</p>
               <p>Bp. <hi>The queſtion between us and the Socinians, is not about meritorious, and promeritorious Cauſe. R.</hi> I wonder the Bp ſhould inſinuate ſo great a falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, when he knows the queſtion between us and the Socinians, is whether our Sins were the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of Chriſt's ſufferings, or occaſional? And it's that which hath been at preſent under hand;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41447:41"/>Promeritorious being a word of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s bringing in; it may be they might not think of it, to hide occaſional under it, as he doth, to make Men think he did not deny all merit in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>Bp. <hi>But the queſtion is, whether Chriſt did really undergo the Puniſhment of our Sins in order to be a Sacrifice of Atonement for them? And in this we have Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s conſent expreſs'd on all occaſions. R.</hi> I wonder the Bp can ſpeak thus, why doth he not acquaint us then with his conſent in one paſſage; if he hath any ſuch paſſage, doth he mean as he ſpeaks? No, no more than the Bp, who could not, as long as he held that Chriſt bore the perſonal guilt or deſert of none.</p>
               <p>It is now evident the Bp hath ſaid nothing to the purpoſe for vindication of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> what hath been ſaid hath been for a greater confirmation of the Charge, and wounding his own Cauſe.</p>
               <p>He ſaith little further, but to excuſe, 1. Liberty muſt be given to Metaphyſick Heads. 2. Tells a Story of <hi>Lubbertus</hi> and <hi>Mcacovius.</hi> 3. He tells us of favourable interpretations, that are to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Perſons, that keep to the main point, as if this were but a trifling matter between the Socin, and us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>L.</hi> argues that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſpeaks after the Unitarians. — <hi>That Chriſt did not undergo puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly ſo called, but in a popular ſenſe of Puniſhment.</hi> The Bp in anſwer doth fill up <hi>p.</hi> 162, 163, 164, 165, 166. in ſhewing what ſlippery Gentlemen, the Writers of the Unitarian Doctrine are, but nothing to Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Charge of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yields the truth thereof, and agrees with Mr. <hi>L.</hi> in theſe words. Bp. you ſay, <hi>Rectoral Juſtice doth eſſentially reſpect the Law in its diſtributions,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41447:41"/>— Whatever a Soveraign may do in acts of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. — A Rector cannot juſtly inflict Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on an innocent perſon as ſuch. Here I grant you have come up to the true ſtate of the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Socin. and us;</hi> and therefore we ſhall leave it, and let the Reader judge who is caſt at the Bp's Bar.</p>
               <p>But before I end, it's neceſſary to conſider how the Bp. doth reconcile his two Principles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Sin of Man was the immediate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive and meritorious Cauſe of Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igns: This he holds againſt the Socinians and Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Chriſt bore not the Perſonal Guilt of any Legally, but that all Perſonal Guilt remains on the Sinner, and was not legally transferred to Chriſt. For this he ſaith, <hi>P.</hi> 167.</p>
               <p>Bp. 1. <hi>We ſay, that Puniſhment may be juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlicted, where there was a Tranſlation of Guilt by Relaxation of the Law, as to perſonal Offenders, and admitting a Mediator to ſuffer in their ſtead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> No Guilt is tranſlated by Relaxation of a Law, for that diſpenceth only. 2. If the Law be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed as to Perſonal Offenders, the doing of thoſe things aſter the relaxation, is not Sin, which was ſo before; what needs a transferring to another? 3. If the Precept be not relaxt (which they will be loath to ſay it is) then the Penalty muſt; and if ſo, either to a part only, or to the whole: If to the whole, what need is there of a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If to a part only, then part of the Sin only is transferred, and Chriſt Died only for ſome part of our Sin, not all. Hence one part of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is owing to the relaxed Law, and the other to Chriſt. Hence Chriſt did not ſatisfie the Law, in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41447:42"/>proper and ſtrict Nature of it, and Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were improper Puniſhments, according to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> And here the Bp runs on ground.</p>
               <p>Bp. He ſaith, 2. <hi>Abſolute Promiſes of the New-Covenant, on which ſo much weight is laid, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comparing them with other places) ſpeak no more of Chriſt's Sufferings, than they do of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in us.</hi> Here our own Qualifications and Performances, are made to have an equality of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionality, foederally with Chriſt's Sufferings; and if Chriſt's Sufferings be meritorious, ſo are they too.</p>
               <p>Bp. 3. <hi>The notion of Satisfaction lays the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Antinomianiſm, which attributes unto God ſuch a ſort of vindictive Juſtice which requires an abſolute and perfect Satisfaction in the ſame kind for the Sins of Mankind. R.</hi> How much this kind of ſatisfaction borders upon Socinianiſm in the true meaning of it, it's eaſie to judge; and what little reaſon the Bp had to reject the Principles that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> built upon is manifeſt, being a firmer Foundation for his building; And after all that he hath ſaid againſt them, as too much favouring Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, he is fain to lay hold on them to ſupport his own Fabrick. See here the pitiful ſhifts Men are put to that wander from the way of truth.</p>

               <head>Arguments to prove that Chriſt bore the Perſonal Guilt of all them for whom he Suffered.</head>
               <p>THAT the leſs intelligent Reeader may not be at loſs for the truth, not ſo eaſily finding it among the Controverſal Difficulties of a Diſpute, I have thought good to make plain proof of this great Queſtion in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>And that we may prevent enlargements, I premiſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by Perſonal Guilt, is meant the Guilt of every particular Perſon for whom Chriſt Died; as of <hi>Noah, David,</hi> and <hi>Peter, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I take Guilt and Sin, and the merit and deſert of Sin, to be equivalent terms in the ſenſe of the Spirit of God; and though the Scripture uſe the word Sin, and we moſt commonly ſay Guilt, this is exegetical, to ſhew that we mean not that the Subjective Phyſical Act of Sin was transferred to Chriſt; nor the inherent. Moral Pollution: But whatever is in either, that is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law, the Law-relation of all Sin, ſo far as the Law condemns the Sinner for it, was charged on Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> Legally and Juridically in the Juſt God's diſtribution of Juſtice. Then I argue,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. He that was puniſht for Sin, bore Sin in the Perſonal Guil, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Legal Charge of it, as the reaſon of his Puniſhment; but Chriſt was puniſht for it by the Conceſſion of our oppoſites, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Major is true. 1. Becauſe God is Juſt. 2. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment without a Reaſon is very unjuſt. 3. There
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41447:43"/>was no reaſon in Chriſt abſolutely conſidered for his Puniſhment, therefore in ſome others; therefore the Perſonal Sin of ſome or other. 4. Without a bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin in the legal deſert of ſome or other, he could not be juſtly puniſhed by the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. He that was made Sin for us, was made ſo by charging our Sins upon him, bare Perſonal Guilt; for he was made that, which he was not in himſelf: Now how could he be made ſo, but by an imputation of the Sins of others to him, a legal proceeding with him in judicature; which could be no other than by Judging and Puniſhing him for ſome Guilt that merits the Wages of Death? The Anſwer the Socinians and others make to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. is that he was made Sin as the Sacrifices were, becauſe a Sin-offering is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: But I anſwer, 1. It was eſſential to the Sin-offering to have the the Perſonal Guilt of the Sinner charged upon it. 2. When <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed for a Sin-offering, it's <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 3. The Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> doth only uſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> when he ſpeaks of Chriſt's bearing Sin, which laſt word is never uſed for Sin-offering. 4. He was made Sin as we are made Righteous; now we are not made Righteous by being made Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for Sin, but by imputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. He that bore the Curſe of the Law to Redeem us from it, bore alſo the Perſonal Guilt of our Sins; but Chriſt bore the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. For the Major it's as clear as the Sun, becauſe Curſe is inſeparable from Sin; the Law curſeth no where but where it finds Perſonal Guilt. Let theſe Men tell me where a Curſe falls upon the head of any one, but of ſuch wherein there is Sin in ſome legal ſenſe or other.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41447:43"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the Prieſts and Sacrifices of old, the Types of Chriſt and his Sufferings, had the Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Guilt of Sin laid upon them, then Chriſt the Antitype, in his Sufferings, had Perſonal Guilt laid upon him: But the Antecedent is without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, yea, and the Conſequence; becauſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype is to anſwer the Type, in all things wherein it is a Type.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If they that were Puniſhed by the Law, did bear their Perſonal Sins by the Law; then if Chriſt, was Puniſhed by the Law, he alſo bore Sin by the Law. But the Antecedent is true by the Scripture, both in them that are recorded to have been Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in Perſon for their own Sins, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.20. and 22.9. and 24.15. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.13. and 14.34. and 18, 22, 32. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.49. and in ſuch as are recorded to have been Puniſhed or Suffer for others, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. The Conſequence muſt be true if Chriſt was Puniſhed by Law, and was one that Suffered for others; the proof whereof the Scripture is full of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If Chriſt bore not Perſonal Guilt, but every one's Perſonal Guilt ſtill remains, then the Spirit of God taught <hi>David</hi> to pray after his Sin in vain, <hi>Deliver me from Blood guiltineſs, O God.</hi> But <hi>David</hi>'s Prayer was not in vain, but was he delivered from his Perſonal Guilt of Blood? Or elſe he muſt at this day be a Blood-guilty Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. A Surety to God for Sinners, bears their Sins in being Puniſhed for them; but Chriſt was a Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. There's no fence againſt ſuch a Flail as this one expreſs place. 2. The Minor is quarrelled by our Adverſaries, but not Univerſally denied, yet they would make a ſeeming Evaſion, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41447:44"/>they will have Chriſt a Surety for God to us, and not for us to God; and that Chriſt was no Money-Surety for us, we being Criminals; and that Sin muſt not be lookt on as a Debt; the folly of all which hath been made ſufficiently manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. If the Perſonal guilt of Sin was taken away by Jeſus Chriſt, then Chriſt muſt bear Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Guilt: But the Guilt of Perſonal Sins was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by Chriſt, as appears by 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>He took away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf:</hi> Sin cannot be ſaid to be taken away, if it be not taken away in the Perſonal Guilt. The Major appears from the Type of the Scape-Goat, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. Where there's <hi>no Condemnation,</hi> there Perſonal Guilt is taken away, <hi>nor nothing to be laid to the Charge of a Perſon;</hi> but there's no Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, (<hi>i. e.</hi> Reaſon of Condemnation in the Eye of the Law) in a Believer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. for there's no Reaſon of Condemnation, but Guilt of Sin; and none takes off the reaſon of our Charge of Fault to Law Condemnation, but Chriſt by bearing Sin unto Puniſhment and Satisfaction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. For where there is the Perſonal Guilt of Sin, there's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Now this Freedom from Condemnation was fully obtain'd and procured by Chriſt's Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but the <hi>purchaſed Right</hi> is not received and poſſeſſed till Application; till then a Sinner is ſhut up and impriſoned under the Law, as to State and Conſcience; but when he is in Chriſt Jeſus by Faith, he is fully inſtated in the purchaſed Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. If Chriſt's Puniſhment was without his bearing of our Perſonal Guilt, there was no change of Perſons between Chriſt and us, according to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. for as we were, ſo we remain to be guilty Sinners; and ſo long as we are ſo, we cannot be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41447:44"/>righteous; we can't be made the Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt, ſo long as we remain guilty Sinners in our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. Where Perſonal Guilt remains, there's no Acceptation with God; for all our Acceptation, either of Perſons or Services, is in Chriſt, God profeſſing he will not clear the Guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 12. I might argue from all thoſe places of Scripture that ſpeak out this Truth fully and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which cannot have any rational Senſe put upon them, no leſs than three times in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. who his own ſelf bare our Sins in his Body on the Tree.</p>
               <p>There's no one Truth in the Scripture, that is more fully and plainly recorded in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and New. The Spirit telling us of a Believer's <hi>Sin covered, not imputed, Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Of our <hi>being made nigh to God, and Chriſt being our Peace, Eph.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. Likewiſe Chriſt <hi>died the juſt for the unjuſt, to bring us unto God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. But this is enough to confirm the weak, and to convince Gainſayers, and to lead all the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Truth into the Mind of the Spirit in this great Article of our Faith.</p>

               <head>The Presbyterian Articles againſt the Diſſenting Brethren Anſwered.</head>
               <p>I Had thought when I began this Task to have paſſed over the firſt part altogether; for tho' I found it a very falſe Hiſtory, yet I knowing from whoſe Hands the Bp. had it, I did not think he was chargeable ſo much with the falſhood, as with an unjuſt unwarineſs and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, to take up the Report of a Difference, and to publiſh the Hiſtory of it to the World from one
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41447:45"/>Party only concerned therein, I deem'd therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to refer the Reader to the true Hiſtory of the <hi>Union and Breach;</hi> but upon the review of the ſaid falſe Hiſtorical Account; and finding a freſh Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought in againſt the Diſſenting Brethren from the late Union, by the <hi>grand Rebuker</hi> under divers Articles, for holding and publiſhing many poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome dangerous Hereſies, of ſo miſchievous a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he teacheth his tractable Reader a form of Prayer, to uſe ſtill before he reads them; to wit, that he may <hi>not ſuck in the Bane and Poyſon thereof.</hi>
               </p>

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the particular Articles, it's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to premiſe a few things; that now,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I think it neceſſary for my ſelf to appear to the Accuſations, and make publick Anſwer to them, but do not undertake that all I ſay is the Senſe of my Brethren in every Particular; I ſuppoſe they may concur with me ſo far, that ſome different Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions will make no Breach in our mutual Love and Affections.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:41447:45"/>

That they publiſh theſe for Errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had diſputed them with ſuch as they charge, and proved them ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let me ask our angry Brethren a few Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for my Information. 1. Whether they think in their Conſciences, and in the ſight of God, they have dealt uprightly and ſincerely with the Truth, and with their Brethren in this Controverſie? 2. Whether it becomes the Saints to appear ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick bitter Accuſers of their Brethren, as appears by the foul-mouth'd Rebuker, and others, whoſo have been employ'd and applauded in this dirty Service? 3. Whether it be for the Honour of the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts thus to bewray their own Neſts? 4. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they think not in their Conſciences that many things they charge for Errors are great Truths in ſome Sence or other? Therefore is it not very unfair to charge in general and dubious terms, without any Diſtinctions or Explications? Doth this become learned Divines?</p>
               <p>The Rebukers Articles which he brought into Court were, I find to the number of 21, but it ſeems the judicious Bp. contracted them to Six, which he hath called us to appear to, looking upon the reſt (I ſuppoſe) as frivolous, illiterate or ſpiteful; the Six, with my reſpective Anſwers, are as follows.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:41447:46"/>
               <p>Er. 1. <hi>That Pardon is rather the Condition of Faith, having a cauſal Influence thereunto, then Faith and Repentance are of Pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Words were mine in <hi>tranſitu</hi> of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and therefore it is very unfair to expoſe them, without ſhewing their Dependance. 1. I have ſhewn, and proved, and will ſtand by it, that <hi>Pardon, Faith and Repentance,</hi> belong not to the conditional Part of the new Covenant, but to the Promiſory. 2. That Pardon, Faith and Repentance, altho' they are not Foederal Conditions, yet being connected in the Promiſe, may have a Connexion conditional given to them, as if a Man believe he receiveth Pardon, in believing; if he repent, he will believe; if he repent, and believe, he ſhall be ſaved; and I renounce not the Scripture Language in anything, but deſire to underſtand and explain it in its true and genuine Senſe. 3. I ſay, that if we talk of the Foederal Conditionality of Faith to Pardon; Pardon is rather a Foederal Condition of Faith and Repentance, than Faith of Pardon; I ſay, not that it is, but rather becauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Pardon aright into Active and Paſſive; I ſay, Pardon Paſſive received can't be without Faith to receive it, but Pardon Active muſt be before Faith. 1. Becauſe the Object that the Hand receives muſt be before the Inſtrument that receives it. 2. The Grace of Pardon is in God to be beſtowed before we receive it. 3. There is Pardon in Chriſt for all that ſhall believe, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.20. See what Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> ſaith on this point, <hi>It is one thing for all the Sins of all the Elect to be pardoned to Chriſt for them; that was done before we were, or our Sins were, another thing to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to them; Chriſt was made a Curſe for us by Imputation, for that the Father did impute all our Sins, as a Judge to Chriſt, as our Surety,</hi> [the true
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41447:46"/>notion of Imputation, that it is not an Act of Grace, but a Judicial Act] <hi>and God did exact all of him as guilty by that Law,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Pardon in God and in Chriſt hath a cauſal Influence on Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: 1. Pardon is an eſſential cauſe of a pardoned Perſon, the Abſtract being the formal cauſe of the Concrete; pardoning Grace doth effectually work all Graces of the Spirit in us, the pardoning Grace of the Father, Son, and Spirit. 2. The Goſpel preached to Sinners, which is Pardon of Sin; the Goſpel preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is that which works Faith thro' the effectual Operation of the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. And it was preached to <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.17. as done before his particular Repentance, expreſs'd <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. therefore if we talk of Foederal Conditions, Pardon is rather ſuch, than Faith and Repentance, becauſe it's in Nature as well as Time antecedent; and ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, as hath a cauſal Influence. And hence I alſo aſſert, that every neceſſary antecedent, tho' with cauſal Influence upon the conſequent, is not a Foederal Condition.</p>
               <p>Er. 2. <hi>That Sin it ſelf, as oppoſed to Guilt, was laid on Chriſt, and Chriſt was reputed a Criminal, not only by Man, but God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As to the firſt clauſe, they ſhould have pointed out the Perſon that ſaid it. If I ſpake it, or writ it, I was aſleep then; for when we ſay Sin was laid on Chriſt, we ſpeak not of it by way of Oppoſition unto Guilt, but by way of Identity or Sameneſs with Guilt, in the Dialect of the Spirit of God, our uſe of the Word Guilt, being but an apt Exegetical Term to expreſs the meaning of Sin in this Point, becauſe the Phyſical <hi>Subſtratum</hi> of Sin can't be transferred to another, but the Law Relation may.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:41447:47"/>
               <p>As to the ſecond charge, 1. It will be eaſily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Accuſers, that a Sinner's Debts to the Law are Crimes. 2. To ſay he was a reputed Criminal in Law only, is by a received Senſe to juſtifie the perſonal and abſolute Innocency of Chriſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 3. I ſuppoſe they will not deny, that if Sin was charged on Chriſt for the delivery of Sinners, it was done by God as his Act, and not by the falſe Accuſation of Satan or his Inſtruments; for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Sinners, by his bearing Sin, was never their Deſign; and it's ſaid God laid upon him the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of us all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4. The term Criminal might poſſibly be uſed by ſome or other, with a good Meaning, but I look not upon it as <hi>proper,</hi> and I don't know that I have uſed it; if I have, I have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſidered of it. 1. Becauſe tho' the Scripture ſaith Sin was laid on Chriſt, and that he was made Sin, yet it ſaith not that he was a Sinner, or a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. 2. Becauſe his bearing Sin, and being made ſo, it plainly implies that he was not ſo in himſelf, but made ſo by Law Imputation, and by ſtanding in a Surety relation to the Law for us. 3. A Sinner or Criminal doth in an ordinary and common Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation import a Committer, or Perpetrator of Sin, which Chriſt never was not reputed by God ſo to be. Therefore herein God ſhews his wonderful Wiſdom, in teaching us to ſpeak of Chriſt in this great Myſtery with ſo much Exactneſs.</p>
               <p>Er. 3. <hi>That the Doctrine of Juſtification before Faith is not an Error, but a great and glorious Truth, and therefore we believe that we may be juſtified decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is an Error, and it is not an Error; it is an Error to ſay Juſtification by Faith is before Faith in time, and a contradiction in <hi>Adjecto,</hi> therefore I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41447:47"/>ſaid ſo for Juſtification by Faith can't be before Faith is in the Receiver to receive it by: But that Juſtification is before Faith, is a glorious Truth; and this I muſt affirm for Truth, that there is Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before Faith, if we diſtinguiſh of Juſtification aright, as of Pardon, and ſay it's actively and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to be underſtood; active Juſtification is in God that juſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the Grace of Juſtification a Gift to us. 2. Chriſt as the Head and Repreſentative of the Elect, was juſtified, and all the Elect fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in him, elſe Jeſus Chriſt's ſuffering as a publick Perſon, could not have been, he was taken <hi>from Priſon and Judgment.</hi> 3. Juſtification in Application, is by Nature before Faith, becauſe all Grace apprehends the Sinner before he apprehends it, and is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cauſe of a Sinner's apprehending it. Again, the Grace of Juſtification is in nature before Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the Foundation of it by the conſent of Proteſtants; and therefore it's ſaid in that Sence, that God juſtifies the ungodly; not that we ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, but that he finds and takes us in that State; and ſo doth the ſanctifying Grace of God in Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God doth both juſtifie and ſanctifie the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by his active apprehending Grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. As to the ſecond clauſe I ſuppoſe none can deny, that therefore we believe that we may be juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. and elſewhere; and as to the laſt Word, wherein they lay the ſtreſs of the Error, they might put it in unexceptionable Terms by adding a monoſyllable, <hi>they believe that they may be juſtified, and declaratively,</hi> they believe that they may receive, and have Eternal Life, and that they may know they have it, according to the expreſs Words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12, 13.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:41447:48"/>
               <p>Er. 4. <hi>Union to Chriſt is before Faith at leaſt by Nature; and we partake of the Spirit by virtue of that Union, and there's a compleat Union with Chriſt before the Act of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For the firſt clauſe of the charge I own it, and have defended it as Truth, and ſhall ſtand by it, and am ready to diſpute it with the Accuſers when they pleaſe; in the mean time, let them tell me whether Faith be not a vital Act of the Soul? If ſo, how came the Fruit to grow on the Branch before it was in the Root, Chriſt Jeſus? Again, if Faith be the Effect of Union to Chriſt, then Union is the cauſe, and in Nature antecedent to it. There's no need to enlarge upon ſo plain a Truth, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond clauſe is as true, that by virtue of this Union, or in this Union we firſt partake of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit is <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8. The Spirit is the Bond of this Union; for, 3. I know not whether it be mine in the terms expreſſed, but if it were, there was ſomething ſaid to explain it; the Senſe I am ready to defend it in is this, that whatever Union Chriſt makes is compleat in it ſelf, ſuch is vital Union in Regeneration, where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated is altogether paſſive; and all Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perfect, tho' the regenerated is not; every one conceived is perfectly conceived, tho' the conceived is not perfectly grown; every one born is perfectly born, tho' every one born is not perfect; ſo is every one born of the Spirit, he hath compleat Life, tho' he is not compleat in the Acts of Life; compleatneſs of Life, and compleatneſs in exerciſing the Acts of Life, are to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Er. 5. <hi>It is a great Truth, that God ſees no Sin in a Believer, and Sin can do no Hurt to a Believer; God is not diſpleaſed with his People, and is not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41447:48"/>angry with the Perſons of Believers for their Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Here are the 12, 13, 14 of the Rebuker's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles crowded together. As to the firſt, I ſay, 1. They are the Words of Scripture, let the Exceptors ſhew and prove that the Spirit of God means quite contrary to what it ſaith in that Place; <hi>Num.</hi> 21.21. and that all other Places of Scripture that confirm this Truth are falſe, and mean quite contrary; as when it ſaith a Believer is bleſſed his Sins, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and not imputed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. This is Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but the meaning is, He is bleſſed whoſe Sin is uncovered before God, and his Iniquity imputed; when God ſaith he doth not remember our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you muſt read it, He doth remember our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Let them give a rational Senſe, of <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. <hi>ch.</hi> 10.17.</p>
               <p>But let them not take us to be ſo ſtupid, as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this of the Eye <hi>of his Omniſciency,</hi> but in reſpect of the Eye <hi>of his Juſtice, Pſal.</hi> 51.9. when they give us any probable Interpretation of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Places of Scripture, ſo to prove the Word of God falſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. In the Senſe we take it, as I could never ſee yet the greateſt of them ever did, we will acknowledge it an Error, in the mean time let them give us leave to believe it, and receive it as an Article of Faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Clauſe the Rebukers 13 is, <hi>That Sin can't do any real Hurt to a Believer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Why is this charged upon the diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Did they ever hear any one of them aſſert it <hi>in Terminis;</hi> he that uttered it in the Ardency of a popular Diſcourſe was above 50 Years ſince, and is it Blaſphemy or Hereſie to defend a good Man's Diſcourſe by a charitable Interpretation? If they had a Grain of Charity, they may eaſily ſee that he meant
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41447:49"/>not according to that groſs Senſe they would put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaying, that he intended not to countenance Profeſſors living in Sin, nor in reſpect of Grief, Sorrow and Darkneſs, occaſioned by a Believer's Fall into Sin, but his meaning was, 1. That their Falls into Sin ſhould not prejudice that State of Union to Chriſt, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 36, 37, 38. 2. That tho' Sin remain in them, yet they ſhall not have Dominion over them, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14, 15. 3. That tho' they fall, they ſhall ariſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.8. 4. That God will over-rule all the Falls of his Children for their Spiritual Good and Advantage, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith <hi>real hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing here, which is the Rebuker's 14th, <hi>God is not diſpleaſed with his People,</hi> i. e. <hi>their Perſons. A.</hi> Why do they not explain what they mean by God's diſpleaſure; do they mean <hi>Paternal or Vindictive:</hi> If they mean Paternal, in a way of Rebuke and Chaſtiſment, who denies it? If they mean Vindictive, we deny it. Again, why do they not tell us what they mean by God's People, do they mean a Collection of Profeſſing People, Church or Nation? Such may be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Defection of theſe from their Profeſſion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver real and true, that God's Vindictive Wrath may go forth againſt them, as often againſt his People of Old. Laſtly, God is never pleaſed with the Sins of his People, therefore condemned all their Sins in the Fleſh of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. But God is not diſpleaſed with the Perſons of his People, ſuch as are called according to purpoſe, becauſe he loved them with an Eternal Love; and he is a God that changeth not.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:41447:49"/>
               <p>Art. 6. <hi>Believers are as Righteous as Chriſt. A.</hi> Moſt know who is Charged here, it is one that is gone to give up his Account to his Lord and Maſter: I doubt not but it is with Joy, and that he hath received a Crown of Glory that fadeth not: Tho' the Rebuker hath trampled upon his Bones and Memory, in his Pride and Inſolency; and not only upon his, but on thoſe of that other Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Servant of God that is at reſt with him: And why? Becauſe both of them in their Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſerved their Generation, in bearing faithful Teſtimony to the Truths of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I need ſay nothing to this Article: That worthy Servant of Chriſt ſpake enough to explain himſelf in that Poſition, in his Printed Sermons which he Preached at <hi>Pinner's</hi>-Hall: The ſum of it was, that he meant not in reſpect of Sanctification, for there our beſt Holineſs is imperfect, therefore he <hi>means not in a way of Similitude</hi> to his Perſonal Holineſs and Righteouſneſs; <hi>but in a way of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, i. e.</hi> in reſpect of a Believer's relation to the Law, as Chriſt hath made full Satisfaction to the Law for a Believer, ſo he is as fully diſcharged from the Law, and condemnation thereof, as Chriſt is, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Law hath no more to do to condemn a Believer, than to condemn Chriſt: His full Original Diſcharge having been in Chriſt, the thing is made plain by an illuſtration. A Rich Alderman pays a Poor Man's Debt of 10<hi>l.</hi> and ſets him at liberty from the Proſecution of the Law, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which done, the Poor Man can be no more Proſecuted by the Law, than the Rich Alderman; being as Righteous in the Eye of the Law as the Alderman: But he cann't ſay, he is as Rich, as Wiſe, as Valuable in Eſtate or Perſon; or ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41447:50"/>Able to pay the Debts of others as the Alderman.</p>
               <p>I know Mr. <hi>M.</hi> was not the firſt that inſiſted on this Notion, I have read it in Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> of <hi>N. E.</hi> as I take it, in his <hi>Sound Believer;</hi> and I am ſure the Rebuker cann't call him an Antinom. As for my own part, I chuſe not to uſe the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (tho' it's in Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s. <hi>Accept.</hi> a Truth) becauſe many that are ſhort in Underſtanding, are apt to abuſe it; and others to make an advantage thereof to wreak their malice againſt the great Truths of the Goſpel, as theſe Accuſers have done. But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, becauſe I apprehend the truth therein contained may be delivered in leſs offenſive words.</p>
               <p>The Bp hath pitched upon Ten of the Rebuker's Articles, and reduced them to Six; there is about Eleven more which he thought had no weight or ſence in them. As,</p>
               <p>Ac. 1. <hi>To talk of a Goſpel threat, is at beſt a Catechreſis; and nothing elſe can ſave it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bull;</hi> I ſuppoſe the Bp thought that no Scholar could make an Error of it. I am the Man that wrote it, and I will ſtand by it as a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Reflection upon ſuch as talk ſo improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impertinently.</p>
               <p>Ac. <hi>As to the Elect, there was never any guilt upon them, in reſpect of the Righteous Judgment of God,</hi> in foro Dei: <hi>But that which accompanied the Letter of the Law, ſetting in with Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Article it ſeems the Bp could make nothing of, nor I; indeed it being one that <hi>M. W.</hi> hath patcht up. For I deny not the Elect are under the Law, and Children of Wrath according to it, till effectual calling; but that God's Vindictive Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment is ever executed upon them, I do deny.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:41447:50"/>
               <p>Ac. 9. <hi>It is denied that God requires Faith as an indiſpenſible Qualification in them, whom he will juſtifie for Chriſt's Merits. A.</hi> This ſmells of Mr. <hi>W.</hi>'s qualifying Righteouſneſs; all is Goſpel with the Rebuker, which he hears from his Oracle. Now to give a brief Anſwer here, becauſe I have diſputed this Article with the Gentleman already. I do not deny that God requires Faith, and will work Faith in all thoſe that God will juſtifie by Faith, but I deny that God requires Faith indiſpenſibly in all that he will juſtifie by Chriſt's Merits; for he juſtifies ſaved Infants by Chriſt's Merits, but who can ſay Faith is required of them? <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He doth not require Faith in any as a ſubordinate quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Righteouſneſs, to Juſtification by Chriſt's, for ſuch it is the Gentleman would have, which I have formerly refuted, but all Men muſt be Hereticks with the Presbyterians, that ſay not after him.</p>
               <p>Ac. 10. <hi>All that a Believer can pray for is, the further Manifeſtation of Pardon, for he knows that all his Sins are pardoned. A.</hi> This is <hi>Ejuſdem fari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae &amp; Originis:</hi> 1. I ſuppoſe a Believer may know that all his Sins are pardon'd, or elſe the Scripture ſpeaks much in vain. 2. Is it a poyſonſome Error to pray for a further Manifeſtation of pardoning Grace, and Confirmation in, and Continuance of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? 3. If a Man do not know his Sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, or doth doubt of it, ſure he will pray that he may be Partaker of pardoning Grace, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Knowledge of it; I know none of the accuſed but do pray thus, and that daily, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes,</hi> as we pray for daily Bread when we have it in the Houſe; for whatever we have of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or outward good things, it is God muſt give unto us richly to enjoy it.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:41447:51"/>
               <p>Ac. 15. <hi>Legal Convictions before Faith are no more than Sin, it's but a filthy Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that Author and his ſecond can do can't make any better of it. So ſaith the Spirit of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. and the Bp. knew that the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſaid ſo, and therefore he inſerts it not as an Error.</p>
               <p>Ac. 16. <hi>All imperfect Holineſs is Sin. A.</hi> Who ſaid ſo?</p>
               <p>This is another dab of <hi>W.</hi>'s Spittle, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buker hath likct up.</p>
               <p>Ac. 17. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die? Is but the Triumph of the Law over a dead Sinner. A.</hi> I argued the meaning of that Place with <hi>D.W.</hi>'s, and ſhew'd that it could be for no other end than to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> of their Inability in themſelves, (that truſted to their own Strength and Righteouſneſs inherent) to work out their juſtifying Righteouſneſs and Salvation, and to bring them to the Grace of God in the Promiſe; the Truth of which I am ready to diſcuſs with any of them.</p>
               <p>Ac. 18. <hi>I can't make Head or Tail of; he ſhould have told us where he had it, or how he came to dream of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ac. 20. <hi>Chriſt's Incarnation was no part of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. A.</hi> The terms are falſly charged, there's no Man that ſaith that Chriſt's Abode in the Fleſh was not his Humiliation, and what he ſuffered in it; but if he means the Divine Nature's Aſſumption it ſelf of Fleſh this was an Act of Divine Power; I ſay, the taking of our Nature; for he could not be humbled in the Divine Nature, therefore he took Man's, that he might be humbled in it after his Aſſumption. This was a wiſer and more learned Man's Opinion than they that oppoſe it. If the Rebuker had read Dr. <hi>Ames</hi>'s <hi>Medulla,</hi> one would think he ſhould have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41447:51"/>been aſhamed to put it down as a baneful and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonſome Error, altho' Mr. <hi>W.</hi>'s did, who it may be never heard of it till Mr. <hi>M.</hi> preached it. The Bp. here caſt it out, and as not conſonant to the Rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Form of Prayer.</p>
               <p>Ac. 21. <hi>We coaleſs upon believing into one Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſon with Chriſt, which is diſtinguiſh'd from Legal Union, which is before Faith. A.</hi> Sure the Rebuker and his learned Maſter ſhew'd themſelves mighty acute Divines here at laſt; for they ſeem to take the myſtical Body of Chriſt for a great Error; for that the Error lyes, in aſſerting that Believers are Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, if they miſtake not Perſon for Body. 2. If they accuſe any for ſaying Believers make one myſtical Perſon with Chriſt, they ſhould have detected that ignorant Perſon, and not charged it on their diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren; ſurely they are not ſuch pitiful Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as not to diſtinguiſh between the myſtical Body of Chriſt and his Perſon, and to talk of a myſtical Perſon. 3. This myſtical Perſon muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a legal Union before Faith. Where is this Stuff put together? I challenge theſe Men to tell the Man, and quote the Place where ſuch a Meſs of Nonſenſe is put together; if they do not, it muſt paſs for one of the horrid Defamations, wherewith they have beſpattered their diſſenting Brethren, to render them odious unto the World.

               <head>A POSTSCRIPT.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe we are ſo highly reproached by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries for Antinomians in the great Point of Juſtication, I thought it very needful to tranſcribe ſome few Paſſages out of the Writings of that renowned Servant of Jeſus Chriſt Mr. <hi>Tho. Shephard,</hi> whom none of our bittereſt Opponents can call an Antinomian.</p>
               <p>He ſhews how Chriſt redeems, 1. By Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. By ſtrong Hand. 1. By Satisfaction, in paying a Price for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> Hence Chriſt ſatisfieth Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſtanding in the room of all them whom Mercy decreeth to ſave. A Surety ſtandeth in the room of a Debtor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the room of all Mankind fallen, ſo Chriſt ſtandeth in the room of all Men riſing, or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By taking from them, in whoſe room he ſtood, the eternal Guilt of all their Sins, and by aſſuming the Guilt of all their Sins unto himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.22. Hence <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid Chriſt was the greateſt Sinner by Imputation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By bearing the Curſe and Wrath of God kindled againſt Sin; for God is ſo holy, that when he ſeeth Sin ſticking only by Imputation to his own Son, he will not ſpare him, but his Wrath and Curſe muſt he bear, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. Chriſt drinks up the Cup of all the Elect at one Draught, which they ſhould have been ſipping, and drinking, and tormented with Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Years.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By bringing into the Preſence of God perfect Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. For this alſo God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice required Perfection, Conformity to the Law,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41447:52"/>as well as perfect Satisfaction, in ſuffering for the Wrong offered to the Lawgiver. Juſtice requiring theſe Four Things, Chriſt ſatisfies Juſtice, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them, and ſo pays the Price.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is a Redeemer by a ſtrong Hand. The firſt Redemption by Price finiſhed in Chriſt's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at his Reſurrection, the ſecond is begun by the Spirit in Man's Vocation, and ended at the Day of Judgment, <hi>&amp;c. Sinc. Conv. p.</hi> 102, 103.</p>
               <p>By Satisfaction I underſtand the whole Obedience of Chriſt unto the very Death, both Active and Paſſive, by which we are juſtified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, is not that of the Godhead; (for then what need was there for Chriſt to do or ſuffer?) but that which was wrought in the Manhood: And hence it is finite in it ſelf, tho' infinite in value, in that it was the Righteouſneſs of ſuch a Perſon.</p>
               <p>This Righteouſneſs of God may be conſider'd two ways. 1. Abſolutely in it ſelf. 2. Reſpectively, as done for us.</p>
               <p>Chriſt's abſolute Righteouſneſs is not imputed to us, as he is Mediator, Head of the Church, having the Spirit without meaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are applied for our Good, but are not imputed as our Righteouſneſs. Here the Objections [ſuch as theſe, if Chriſt's Righteouſneſs be imputed to us, then we are Mediators, Heads of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reſpective or diſpenſative Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which ſome call <hi>Juſtitia fide juſſoria,</hi> [Suretiſhip Righteouſneſs] is that whereby Chriſt is juſt for us, in fulfilling the Law, in bearing God's Image we once had, and have now loſt by Sin.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41447:53"/>
                  <hi>And thus we are truly ſaid to be as Righteous as Chriſt by Imputation,</hi> becauſe he kept the Law for us; and here obſerve, that the Queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all that Chriſt did or had is imputed to us as our Righteouſneſs? But whether all that he did for us as a Surety, in fulfilling the Law, be not in Subſtance our Righteouſneſs? Becauſe then we are juſtified by his working Miracles, preaching Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is to caſt Stumbling-blocks before the Blind; ſo that tho' Chriſt doth not beſtow his Perſonal Wiſdom and Juſtice upon another, yet what hinders but that which Chriſt doth by his Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs for another, the ſame ſhould ſtand good for him for whom it is done? For thus it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men.</p>
               <p>Chriſt's Eſſential Righteouſneſs, Infinite Wiſdom, Fulneſs of the Spirit without Meaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not imputed to us, yet theſe have conſpired together to do that for us, and ſuffer that for us, whereby we come to be righteous before God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. This Righteouſneſs therefore imputed to us juſtifies us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. we are ſaid to be made righteous in him, not the Righteouſneſs of God, whereby God is juſt, but whereby we are juſt, oppoſed to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Man, called our own, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. Not Righteouſneſs from him, (as the Papiſts dream) but Righteouſneſs in him. <hi>Sound Believer, p.</hi> 265, 266.</p>

                  <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE former Civilities that I have receiv'd from you, in ſending your Books concerning the Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to me, which I always read, and ſeriouſly conſidered, knowing you to be a Man of Thought, and plain-hearted, <hi>ſine fuco,</hi> which ſome Men are too much ſtarch'd with. Theſe, I ſay, firſt engaged me in this Undertaking, for which I muſt crave your Excuſe, [look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this as the beſt Returns] that I am your Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Doctrine you have deliver'd in the ſaid Books, and laboured ſtrenuouſly to defend; for you know the old proverbial Saying, <hi>Amicus Plato, Amicus Ariſtotiles ſed magis Amica Veritas;</hi> I hope you will not (nor Mr. <hi>Clerk,</hi> whom I join with you as one that pleadeth the ſame bad Cauſe,) have any reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of uncivil Treatment; for if you find any thing pungent, it is not in relation to your Perſons, but to ſuch things in your Tenents, which I conſcienciouſly take to be very pernicious to the grand Truths of the Goſpel, that I have, thro' the Riches of the Grace of God thankfully receiv'd, and not a little experienced the Conſolations in Days of great Trial and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and therefore can't ſee any reaſon from all that you or your Copartner in this Controverſie hath ſaid, to part with thoſe great Doctrines which you oppoſe, nor any way approve of the new Scheme which you and others have held forth to the World of late; I need not tell you how contrary it is to the Doctrine of our firſt Reformers, to the Experiences of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Chriſtians, and how greedily ſwallowed by Men of Popiſh, Arminian and Socinian Principles.</p>
               <p>There was two things, eſpecially of weight with me, that obliged me to this labour. 1. The publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Concern of the Kingdom and Goſpel of Chriſt in the World, which I deſire to have a moſt ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto; inſomuch, that the leaſt and moſt favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41447:54"/>that I can ſay of the Propagators and Promoters of your Opinions in this Neonomian Doctrine, is, that they have been only applauded Captains by Men of blinded Minds, and corrupt Principles, for the conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the People back again into our Spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> which thro' the tender Mercies of the moſt High, they began to be delivered from by the Reformation; and if we once come to this, that the Doctrine of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is as incredible a thing as the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as your great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hath aſſerted, and your ſelf have inſinuated, we may ſay, Good night to the Proteſtant Religion; and to the Papiſts or Atheiſts (as now moſt appears in the Iſſue) take all. I need not inſtance how apt Men of your Principles have been to diſpence with all the parts of inſtituted Worſhip, inſomuch, that it is a hard thing to know what is Sin by your new Law; but I ſhall not expatiate as I could upon this Point. The ſecond thing that had not a little Influence upon me, was, the Commiſeration that I can't but have to your own Soul, and the Souls of others, looking upon your Devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Truth in theſe great Points to be by Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Errors, and ſuch as endanger the Eternal Life promiſed in the Goſpel, if a Man live and die in the Cordial Belief and Embracement of them, and may be juſtly reckoned among the ſtrong Deluſions which God doth judicially give up thoſe to who receive not the Truth in the Love of it. It may be you may have read a Pamphlet, entitled, <hi>A true Relation of the chief Paſſages between Mr.</hi> Anthony Wotton, [the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagator of Neonom. in <hi>England,</hi> ſo far as I can find] <hi>and Mr.</hi> George Walker, <hi>An.

Wherein amongſt other remarkable Accounts that he gives of the unſound doctrinal Opinions which he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oppoſed, and the moſt unfair Dealings he met with from Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and ſome others, in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of <hi>Wotton</hi>'s Doctrine, and prevaricating in thoſe Controverſies. <hi>P.</hi> 25. He hath this Relation: <q>One
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41447:54"/>thing I cannot omit, which was a ſtrong Motive to move divers godly People in <hi>London</hi> to abhor Mr. <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Opinions; <hi>That was the ſharp Cenſure which that holy Man of God, Mr.</hi> Alexander Richardſon, <hi>gave againſt them on his Death-bed,</hi> and which Mr. <hi>John Barlow</hi> did report to divers from his Mouth. Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> being ready to leave this World, Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> who had often before reſorted to him for Direction in his Studies, [as divers young Divines did, ſome of which he mentions, <hi>P.</hi> 6.) and Reſolution of Doubts in many Points of Divinity, was at that time preſent with him, and told him that he had heard me the Sabbath before propounding the Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be laid open out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt Papiſts, Socinians, and other Hereticks; ſome of which were of late revived in the City, and withal deſired to know his Judgment concerning Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi>'s Opinions, <hi>who denied Chriſt's fulfilling the Law for Juſtification of Believers, and the Imputation of his Righteouſneſs, and held Faith to be imputed in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Senſe without a Trope.</hi> Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Take theſe Words of me a dying Man; I have read, and well weighed Mr.</hi> Wotton<hi>'s Papers, and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and I know them to be ſo peſtilent and dangerous, that whoſoever liveth and dieth in the Belief of them, ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Commend me to Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and deſire him from me (as being my laſt Requeſt to him) <hi>to be couragious in the Cauſe of God, and for that ſaving Truth, which he hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to maintain againſt thoſe dangerous and deadly Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors lately ſet on foot by Mr.</hi> Wotton. This Meſſage being delivered unto me before divers Witneſſes, ſome of which are alive to teſtifie it, did much encourage me, and make me more bold to lay open the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi>'s Opinions publickly in my Sermons, without Fear or Regard of the Slanders and Revilings of his factious and furious Diſciples.</q> This was <hi>An.</hi> 1613.</p>

               <p>Now ſuppoſing that you will not lay much ſtreſs upon the Judgment of one of the moſt holy, ſerious and learned Divines ſince the Reformation, as it appears ſuch weighs little with you; let me be ſo bold as to ask you one Queſtion, <hi>Whether upon the matureſt Conſideration you do believe you ſhall in your dying Hour dare to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your Eternal State upon the Bottom that you have laid?</hi> And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Altho' I am ſo much diſſatisfied in your Doctrine, that I muſt needs acknowledge your plain-heartedneſs in the Defence of your Doctrine, (as alſo Mr. <hi>Clerk</hi>'s) yet you do not endeavour to cover and obſcure the Meaning and true Deſign of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Neonom. but have given it to us unmask'd in its proper Colours; <hi>Viz.</hi> That the genuine and proper Nature thereof lyes in the ſetting aſide of the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, and the Imputation thereof, to the Juſtification of a Sinner before God, and to advance the inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Man into the Room and Place thereof.</hi> Moreover I muſt acknowledge you have done right to Truth in what you ſay of the Union that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> made between <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> that they were extreamly out in it. And likewiſe in the plain Proof that you have made, that it is <hi>moſt abſurd to hold and aſſert, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed</hi> in ſe, <hi>and in the Effects too,</hi> and that there can be no <hi>mixed Medium;</hi> either we muſt hold that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>in ſe</hi> and <hi>per ſe</hi> to us for Juſtification, or the <hi>Effects thereof only in our inherent Obedience,</hi> for the Reaſons you give with full Demonſtration. To ſay no more of this now, but only that I think you have effectually ended Diſcord upon that Point; Sir, I ſhall no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you from the enſuing Diſcourſe, but ſubſcribe my ſelf.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41447:56"/>and accepting their Perſons as righteous: Not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Chriſt's ſake alone; nor by imputing Faith it ſelf, the Act of believing, nor any other Evangelical Obedience to them as their righteouſneſs, but by imputing the Obedience and Satisfaction of Chriſt unto them, they receiving and reſting on him and his righteouſneſs by faith, which Faith they have not of themſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi>

               <p>To this Doctrine here delivered with the greateſt Exactneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God, is the Doctrine of <hi>Neonomianiſm</hi> dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite, as will abundantly appear.</p>
               <p>§. 2. They ſay, <hi>Whom God effectually calleth he juſtifieth.</hi>] Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, <q>God juſtifieth all the World; and he and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> 'That Chriſt redeemed all the World, in which there are Millions that were never,</q> or will be effectually called. 2. That <hi>God freely juſtifieth.</hi>] This is fuller expreſſed in the Larger Catechiſm, Q. 70. <hi>Juſtification is an act of God's free grace unto Sinners,</hi> Rom. 3.21, 23, 24. for the <hi>free Grace</hi> is demonſtrated in the Object that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication falls upon. Juſtification conſidered in it ſelf is an act of Juſtice, but the Free Grace lies in bringing Juſtification upon a Sinner, as ſuch, not as qualified by righteouſneſs of his own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Denomination whatſoever; Chriſt <hi>died for the ungodly,</hi> for <hi>enemies,</hi> while yet ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8, 9. it is ſuch <hi>chap.</hi> 3. that are ſaid to be <hi>juſtified</hi> (chap. 4.5.) <hi>by free Grace;</hi> it is ſuch that have <hi>ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> as all, he ſaith, have, both <hi>Jews and Gentiles;</hi> ſuch as are deſcribed, from <hi>v.</hi> 10. of whom <hi>none are righteous, no not one,</hi> but full of all ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as expreſſed with the higheſt aggravation unto <hi>v.</hi> 19. Now our <hi>Neonomians</hi> ſay, its of Free Grace, becauſe Juſtification is <hi>an Inſtance of Grace;</hi> but by Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s. favour, it muſt be in the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a Sinner, not of a juſt one; and therefore its ſaid <hi>freely by Grace,</hi> becauſe he hath nothing, nor brings any thing in or from himſelf. 2. He ſaith, <q>Its in reſpect of what is required of us, or in us, Faith is wrought in us, and its of Free Grace that he accepts of Faith,</q> and imputes it to us for righteouſneſs: This by the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> is rejected as Falſe Doctrine; altho Faith, and all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, are of Grace, yet neither Faith, or any of them, are our righteouſneſs for Juſtification, neither doth God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it as ſuch, nor impute it: Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> mightily perverts <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>therefore it is of faith; 'i. e.</hi> the righteouſneſs before ſpoken of, <hi>is ſuch as he received by faith (he ſaith not therefore it is faith) that it might be of grace,</hi> becauſe as Grace gives freely, ſo Faith receiveth freely, and is not ſo proud as to call it ſelf, righteouſneſs, but glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, humbly and thankfully receives the gift of righteouſneſs, which Grace beſtows, and Juſtice accepts and imputes to Juſtification.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Not by infuſing righteouſneſs into them.</hi>] The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> doth

Note it, for it is expreſs;</hi> and this he ſaith is not the righteouſneſs of the law of works, but of the law of grace, which he ſaith <hi>is a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he doth, but not work in doing,</hi> which is pretty abſurd, that a man ſhould do works of righteouſneſs and not work; but the meaning is, he doth not work perfect works (I will not wrong him:) But do not thoſe that work imperfect works work? <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they that do abſolutely ſinful works, are called workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> A little after he tells us, <hi>Chriſt's Redemption was to bring in a New Law— for when Man fell it was impoſſible he ſhould be righteous any more unleſs there were a new Law brought in, by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof he might attain to that again which he loſt—now this was the main buſineſs of Chriſt's Redemption, the procuring a new law, or another law with lower Terms, which ſome men performing, they do thereby become righteous, and ſo have righteouſneſs, according to that Law imputed to them for Remiſſion and life eternal</hi> — And thus you ſee what everlaſting righteouſneſs Chriſt brought in, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and in his Piece, <hi>Of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which comes forth with Epiſco.

                  <q>The Queſtion in preciſe Terms is this, Whether the Faith of him that truly believes in Chriſt, or whether the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt himſelf— be that which God imputes to a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41447:58"/>for righteouſneſs,</q> or unto Righteouſneſs in his Juſtification, <hi>J.

This Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not that that is imputed unto any man for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but is that for which righteouſneſs is imputed to every man that believeth— <hi>Paul</hi> neither eat his Fingers, nor ſpun out the fleſh of his hands into cloathing, and yet was both fed and cloathed with them</q> [Here's the true ſenſe of being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the effects of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.] <q>So may a Believer be ſaid to be cloathed with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and yet the righteouſneſs of Chriſt not be his cloathing but only that which procured this cloathing unto him.</q> 
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 88. is to evince, <q>That that which God imputes for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Juſtification is not the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt himſelf (in the ſenſe refuſed in the Firſt Chapter,)</q> 'but faith in Chriſt. In the concluſion of the Chap. he ſays, <q>If God in the New Covenant of the Goſpel (<hi>i. e.</hi> the New Law) requires Faith in Chriſt for our Juſtification, inſtead of the righteouſneſs of the Law in the old, and this faith will not paſs with him in account for ſuch righteouſneſs, both his Commandment and Covenant for believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Obedience it ſelf of believing, will become void, and of none effect.</q>

Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> hath a <hi>Chapter</hi> to prove how the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt concurs to our Juſtification, the ſum of all is this, <q>That by the Merits of Chriſt's Death, he has purchaſed this Priviledge for us among others, that ſincere Faith ſhould be accounted for righteouſneſs, and that God will account us righteous if we be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41447:58"/>poſſeſt thereof, <hi>p.</hi> 35. Chriſt hath done his part, but hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us a neceſſary part which muſt be done by our ſelves; this is not to ſupply any deficiency in Chriſt</q> [<hi>i. e.</hi> he hath done well enough for the part alotted him] <q>but it is that which ſubordinately is required of us as the condition of Pardon and Life by his own Law or Covenant of Grace,</q> and ſo far [as a part] 'it is imputed to us for righteouſneſs, <hi>Scr.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> and ſhew the Abſurdity thereof, tho more may be ſaid of both (God willing) hereafter. And the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and we with them, aſſerting the Imputation of the active and paſſive Obedience of Chriſt to the Juſtification of a Sinner, and the <hi>Neonomians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the active righteouſneſs to have any influence on our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, no further than as to the fitneſs of his Perſon to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Mediatorial Office, falling in with <hi>Piſcator, Gataker</hi> and others in this Point, and cannot be handled here, but muſt be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of after-conſideration in treating of Satisfaction. Let not the Reader take it for granted that we grant Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> that Point, <hi>viz. the denial of the active righteouſneſs of Chriſt in our Juſtification,</hi> wherein he hath ſpent a great part of his Treatiſe.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. I Shall not detain the Reader in criticizing on the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Juſtification</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Language, it amounting to what our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word means, and our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in a great meaſure agreeing with us therein (tho differing enough in the <hi>modus</hi> (as appears in the foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi>) that <hi>Juſtification</hi> is directly oppoſed to <hi>Condemnation,</hi> That it is a forin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick or Law-Term, and that properly it is a Law-Sentence, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly and <hi>per ſe</hi> underſtood. That God is the great Juſtifier. That the Perſon juſtified is always upon the account of ſome righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of that Law that juſtifieth. That this righteouſneſs muſt be legally his that is juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> imputed to him without denial of it ſelf; and that Juſtification is the ſentential pronouncing a perſon righteous and accepted by the Lawgiver, free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, righteous in his ſight, and enſtated in all advantages that this righteouſneſs of his brings him into. Thus far I take it we are agreed, what little wordy differences there is, we ſhall not concern our ſelves about, nor trouble the Reader with.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Juſtification in Scripture, and in our uſual and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation, is any Vindication of a Perſon or Action from a Charge or Accuſation brought in or alledged againſt them, and this in the largeſt ſenſe wherein a man is ſaid to juſtifie God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. Its one mans juſtifying another, or vindicating their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this done by pleading for, or defending them, <hi>Job</hi> 27.5. and 33.32. or practically, by doing the ſame thing or worſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.51.55. Or a man is ſaid to juſtifie himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 32. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.29.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41447:60"/>
               <p>§. 3. Juſtification being allowed to be a Forinſick Term, it muſt always ſuppoſe a <hi>Forum</hi> or Court where it is. And all Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt be ſuppoſed to be in one at leaſt, or all theſe Courts, <hi>Forum Dei, Mundi, Conſcientiae,</hi> a true Believer is ſometimes juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all, as to his State and Actions; ſometimes in one, and not in another. The Court, or <hi>Forum Dei,</hi> is where God ſits as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and righteous Judge of his Law, where every one that is ſaved muſt find Acquittance and Acceptance. <hi>Forum Mundi,</hi> is of two kinds, 1. <hi>Common,</hi> wherein the actions of men are judged of, either by Vogue and Reports of the Vulgar, or by the Courts of Judicature among men. 2. It is more ſpecial <hi>in Eccleſiis,</hi> to be tried and judged in a Church of Chriſt. 3. <hi>Forum Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> where God ſits a Judge, and brings the Sinner to the Bar, and Trial, and accordingly Sentence of Condemnation or Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation paſſeth upon a man, or on his Actions. As to the firſt of theſe, all men are tried as <hi>unto their State,</hi> and they are there ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridically acquitted or condemned <hi>in foro Dei, i. e. legis,</hi> either by a Judgment on their own righteouſneſs, which is called <hi>legal righteouſneſs,</hi> or upon a Judgment on them according to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of another, called <hi>Evangelical,</hi> becauſe its of abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to a Sinner, and the freeſt Gift in the World. As to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Forum,</hi> the Courts of the World, the World many ways call Courts of Judicature, and will have Judgment upon men, in the former Court the Judgment is always according to truth, but its not ſo here, for a man may be acquitted there, and condemned here, both Perſons and Actions; nay, let me ſay, a perſon may be acquitted in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> and yet his Actions juſtly condemned in <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro humano, i. e. mundi,</hi> but then I do not ſay, thoſe actions are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> but are burnt for <hi>Hay and Stubble,</hi> as men do juſtifie themſelves and others in this <hi>foro mundi</hi> very often; ſo doth God himſelf juſtifie his children and their actions that are ſo condemned by, and ungrateful to the World: God doth as it were come into it, and vindicate his accuſed Saints, where Satan takes it upon him as his Prerogative to accuſe the Brethren, when his Accuſations run high, God looks upon his Honour engaged to vindicate ſuch, in thoſe eminent, unaccountable, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Actions which they do for his Names ſake. Here we read of God's own vindicating and bearing Teſtimony to the actions of his children that looked ſtrange in the eye of the World. God's juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thoſe Actions before the World is called Juſtification, and their Actions Righteouſneſs; not that the perſons were juſtified thereby, but that they were approved fruits of Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, received by Faith; yea we find, when God comes into the <hi>Court</hi> of the World to declare Perſons or Actions, to be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41447:61"/>approved by him, its uſually in ſome extraordinary thing wherein they were Eminent, and ſuffered much thereupon, at leaſt in their good Name, if not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 4. In this caſe, God juſtifies the Act of <hi>Phineas,</hi> in taking upon him to execute Judgment in the caſe of <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> the action lay condemnable in <hi>Phineas,</hi> as a raſh action, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from an uſurped Authority, he being not High-Prieſt, nor having any particular Commiſſion from <hi>Moſes.</hi> This Action God teſtifies to as a holy and righteous Act, (tho it looked ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial) and ſhould be looked upon as a righteous act to all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. <hi>Phineas</hi> was a juſtified perſon long before, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.12, 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.30, 31. So <hi>Abel offered a more excellent ſacrifice than Cain,</hi> was he not in an accepted and juſtified ſtate before God? for God firſt accepted <hi>Abel,</hi> and then his Offering, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Offering, notwithſtanding God's acceptation, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Cain,</hi> and no doubt by his Poſterity, <hi>he obtained witneſs that he was righteous,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereby he was witneſſed unto, for God witneſſed <hi>in foro mundi,</hi> to the righteouſneſs of <hi>Abel, i. e.</hi> to his Juſtification, in that he made it appear by his manifeſted acceptance, undoubtedly Fire came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and conſumed the Sacrifice; here the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Gifts,</hi> and this was a teſtimony of his Perſon that he was righteous, but this is not the juſtification of his Perſon, for if he had not been juſtified in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> yea <hi>Conſcientiae</hi> too, he could not by faith have offered a Sacrifice ſo well pleaſing to God, wherefore to ſhew to the World that he was an accepted perſon, God teſtifies to his Services. So <hi>Enoch,</hi> he had ſome eminent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony from God before his Tranſlation, againſt all the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating and blaſpheming Poſterity of <hi>Cain.</hi> So <hi>Noah</hi> alſo, in his Generation <hi>a Preacher of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> he had a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the Ark, and the Salvation that he and his Houſe had to both the Worlds and yet this Teſtimony was not that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he had before God, for he was <hi>heir of the righteouſneſs of God by faith,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he was become the heir, not upon building the Ark, but was ſo before.</p>
               <p>§. 5. God's appearing then to witneſs to the Ways and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his People in the World, which the children of men are ſtill condemning of, and their Perſons and Profeſſion for, is not their Juſtification before God, but an eminent fruit thereof. <hi>Abraham</hi> when he offered up his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he exerted the eminent fruit of a tried Faith, which the World would be apt to condemn as one of the heinouſeſt and moſt unnatural in the World, therefore God juſtifies this Action of his, and therein recommends him for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41447:61"/>moſt Eminent Believer, he <hi>not ſtaggering in his faith of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> notwithſtanding, <hi>believing that God could raiſe his ſon from the dead,</hi> and if he ſhould ſlay his ſon, that God would do it rather than not fulfil his Promiſe. Now I dare appeal to our moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Oppoſers, whether they think <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified before this great Action of his, and what can <hi>James</hi> his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be more than God's declaring in <hi>foro mundi,</hi> that this ſtrange action of his, wherein he was a Wonder to the World, and for which he ſtood ready to be condemned by it, was highly approv'd by him, and an eminent Fruit and Teſtimony of his Faith. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the context that <hi>James</hi> underſtood nothing but that a True Faith brings forth Works, witneſſing in <hi>foro mundi,</hi> to the truth of it, and <hi>James</hi> 2.10. and that the offender of the Law in one point, is guilty of all, and that he that is ſaved by faith, is ſaved by <hi>a lively faith,</hi> ſuch as will ſhew it ſelf <hi>by works,</hi> and ſuch as God will teſtifie to by his Word or Providence, or both, <hi>that they are wrought of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Rahab,</hi> The World would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn her for a treacherous Harlot in betraying her Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to deſtruction: But this action of juſtified <hi>Rahab</hi> being a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fruit of her Eminent Faith, is ſignally owned by God himſelf, and her ſtrange action juſtified to the World, that when the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell, her houſe ſtood only, and ſhe ſaved with the Honour and Renown of an exemplary believer in the Church, yea God honoured her ſo far, as to come into the Line of the Meſſiah. Hath not God gloriouſly juſtified his Saints, <hi>i. e.</hi> by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying to their Gifts and Services to the World, whence elſe hath been that eminent Spirit viſible and aſtoniſhing to the World, whereby they have not only rejoiced to ſuffer for the <hi>Name of Jeſus in the ſpoil of their goods,</hi> but <hi>in giving their bodies to death,</hi> and overcame all the Reproaches and Blaſphemies of their cruel enemies, by faith in the blood of the Lamb, and Word of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony: Was not that admirable Preſence of God with them, not only which we read of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. but in other Martyrologies. The Witneſs of God to their Gifts in and to the convincing the World, to which they had never come, had they not been freely juſtified by God before. I am aſhamed to ſee that Men ſhould think that the Saints in their great Services and Sufferings ſhould be of ſuch ſervile and baſe Spirits, as to be bargaining with God by their Works when they were frying in the Flames.</p>
               <p>§. 7. There is alſo a Juſtification <hi>in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> which is received by faith, and cannot be received but by faith, and its a cloſing in with the judgment of God according to truth. Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt be before any perſon can receive it; the <hi>Aſſembly</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41447:62"/>do moſt accurately tell us what <hi>Juſtification by faith</hi> is, <hi>We ſay not, that no man that ſays he believes not his Juſtification is not juſtified, nor every one that ſays he believes it, is juſtified, but we ſay, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that believes truly is juſtified, and every one that's justified, ſhall believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God's Juſtification of a Sinner, is his Juridical Sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Eternal State and Condition, which admits not of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus</hi> and <hi>minus</hi> in God, but admits of different times of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of degrees of manifeſtation; it finds nothing in the creature, nor makes any change but relative, wherein God is firſt in relation, juſtifying and applying that Grace to us, and therefore we are wholly paſſive, till by vertue of Union with Chriſt by the Spirit, the Spirit of Life raiſing us from the dead, we are enabled to believe whereby we make a ſenſible re-application of the Grace of Juſtification to our ſelves, and <hi>being juſtified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But more of this <hi>infra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. The Judge of all the World muſt judge righteouſly, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to his righteous Law, for as that is <hi>norma officii</hi> to us, ſo it is of <hi>judicii</hi> to him; now here is the Myſtery, How God can juſtifie a ſinner according to moſt perfect law, and do it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his <hi>Medio. p.</hi> 5. hath this Quaery, <hi>The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel requires Faith, Repentance, new Obedience, how then are we juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſaved by Grace? how is it free when it is not vouchſafed but upon condition? This difficulty hath made ſome run into the Extream, that the Covenant of Grace is without conditions. Reſp.</hi> It is ſuch an extream Argument againſt the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Doctrine, that all their Skill and Sophiſtry neither hath, nor can anſwer, and the Argument ſtands thus, If nothing doth eſſentially diſtinguiſh a Covenant of Works from a Covenant of Grace, but the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality of it, then a Covenant of Grace muſt have no Condition, and whatever Covenant hath a Condition, is a Covenant of Works; but there's nothing can diſtinguiſh; becauſe the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is true, therefore the Conſequence. There can be nothing in ſenſe to invalidate either Propoſition, for the diſtinguiſhing formal difference between the one Covenant and the other, muſt be Condition, and no Condition, where the true Oppoſition lieth, for the promiſe of both Covenants are life, therefore the ſpecial and formal difference lieth in conditionality, &amp; none; now to ſay, it lies in the nature of the condition, will appear moſt abſurd. 1. If it be the littleneſs of the Condition makes a Covenant of Grace; this I deny, for the promulgated Covenant of Works was laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt condition imaginable, the <hi>forbearing to eat in Apple,</hi> but let us hear what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will ſay to make a Covenant of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41447:62"/>Works a Covenant of Grace, <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>I ſay readily the Grace of God and of the Goſpel is free,</hi> and therefore not conditional; well, but how, wherein is the freedom? <hi>In that it accepts of the ſinners Faith and Repentance, when he needs not, or when according to the law he was not tied to it. Reſp.</hi> Was the Man awake or aſleep when he ſaid this, he ſays its free becauſe God accepts of his Faith and Repentance, that's the ſame freedom whereby I may be ſaid to give a Man a Horſe when I accept of Money which he was to pay me for it: Is not a Covenant a Bargain? Was it not ſo to <hi>Adam?</hi> Was it poſſible he ſhould ſay, he need not accept it? What doth he make of his New-Law-Covenant? need not God keep it? where was God's Faithfulneſs and Truth when he made that Covenant? doth not that bind him to accept our Faith and Obedience as the Condition? <hi>According to the law he is not tied;</hi> Why will an honeſt Man ſpeak ſo equivocally to juſtifie a cauſe his Conſcience tells him, or ought to do, that it is nought, he ſays, <hi>according to the law,</hi> I pray what law? the Old or New? Doth he not ſay, that Faith and Repentance is the Condition of the New Law? and is not God bound to accept of them by that Law? Oh but he is not bound to accept of them by the old law: It is juſt as if a Man brings the Money that I ſold ſuch a Commodity for, and I tell him, I will not take the Money unleſs he will confeſs, I gave him it freely, no ſaith he, I make a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Money with which I bought it, I will neverly for the Bargain, and ſay you gave it me, when I bought it, to which I reply, I am not bound by law to accept the Money. What law? the law that the King and Parliament made for the Pole-Tax. <hi>H.</hi> 
                  <q>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Man's Obedience were perfect, but he is bound by the new law to accept imperfect. Obedience. <hi>H.</hi> our Divines ſay uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</q> becauſe its not of merit— but this labours with ſome defect of light, <q>if man had performed the condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, it might have bin ſaid upon this reaſon that Life and Salvation had bin ſtill of Grace and Free, as not merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while theſe conſiderations hinder merit.</q> How might Man's Obedience in the Covenant of Works be ſaid to be of Free Grace? becauſe his were not proportionable to the reward; no more are good Angels works to this day, <hi>there was Grace in making the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on eaſie Terms,</hi> but when the Covenant is made, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is merited <hi>ex pacto,</hi> by the performed Conditions: Hence the Apoſtle's reaſoning remains unſhaked, <hi>they that are juſtified of debt, are not of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. Mr. <hi>Humphry</hi> makes a fearful bungling about this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and lends us for our help a diſtinction about merit, and ſaith, <hi>There is a debt or merit of Commutative Juſtice, and of diſtributive;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41447:63"/>it is impoſſible that any ſhould engage the Almighty in the former. Reſp.</hi> But the Almighty may engage himſelf in it to the creature, may there not be place for commutative Juſtice between a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and inferiouur? between a King and People all obligatory Covenants upon terms of mutual performances are primarily ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in a way of commutative Juſtice; diſtributive Juſtice comes in for redreſs in caſe of non-performance of mutual agreements, or upon complaint thereof. <hi>Of the latter [i. e.</hi> diſtributive Juſtice] <hi>there is a merit or debt upon compact or ſtrict retaliation; it is true, that there is nothing Man does, or can do in the ſtate of innocency could merit upon ſtrict retaliation. Reſp.</hi> I ſuppoſe he means by his term of <hi>ſtrict retaliation,</hi> rewarding juſt ſo much as the value of the work, more, <hi>i. e.</hi> to reward man juſt as much as the value of not eating an Apple, but the reward promiſed, was infinitely more, and it was promiſed upon ſo ſmall a Condition, therefore upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the condition, the reward, as great as it was, would have become due <hi>ex pacto,</hi> and hence a true debt. But he tells us what a Compact is.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Mr. <hi>H. A Compact may be two-fold, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon Terms equal or unequal: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon terms equal, we know the reward doth become debt, and may he ſaid to be merit; notwithſtanding by way of ſtrict Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or upon account of equal benefit, the performance of the condition would require no ſuch matter. Reſp.</hi> Equality of Terms in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement is, ſo much for ſo much, the mutual performance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is <hi>ſtrict retaliation.</hi> Tho the Term is foreign to the matter in hand, for it belongs to revenge in giving a man as good, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bad as he brings. I deny, that Compact upon Terms equal or unequal, do alter the nature thereof, ſo that the Condition is not a Merit, and the Promiſe a Reward. He ſaith, <hi>If I agree to give a man</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. for his days work, I muſt pay the debt tho the Emolument be not worth half the money.</hi> Here he anſwers himſelf in his ſtrict retaliation, and tho the condition is worth little, yet it is the Compact that makes the Debt upon the performance. And he ſays, <hi>If I promiſe a poor man a ſhilling for leading my Horſe to the next Stile, its Alms, an act of Grace. Reſp.</hi> It ſeems here's but 18 d. difference between Works and Grace. An agreement to give a man 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> for a Days Work makes a Debt, but an agreement to give a ſhilling for leading his Horſe, is Alms; he allowed the mans Days-work prov'd not to be worth above a ſhilling, and yet <hi>ex pacto,</hi> he was indebted to him 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> and why I pray, Is it not as good a Debt to the poor man that he bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains with to lead his Horſe to the next Stile? he will ſay, it was not worth ſo much in ſtrict Retaliation, no more was the other man's Days-work; if he had given the man the ſhilling, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41447:63"/>ſaid, prethee lead my Horſe to the next Stile, he would have ſaid, ay Maſter, and thank you too; but if he agree with him, when he hath done his work, he could demand the Wages as Debt, tho it may be he would thank him for ſo eaſie a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. He tells us, <hi>The firſt Covenant was upon Terms equal, and if man did his duty, tho with the ability God gives him (as if I agree with a man to work with my Tools) the reward is of Merit or Debt. Anſw.</hi> If he means equal in value, I deny that the Firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was ſo any more than the New Law covenant: Ay, but if he means equal as to obligation in a way of commutative Juſtice, <hi>i. e.</hi> that God is as much bound to perform his part after cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, as Man to perform his, then I ſay the New Covenant is as equal as the old, for each is but equality of obligation; but he goes on, <hi>When he gives us the reward, which is eternal life thro his Son, upon obedience which is imperfect</hi> [that is upon a new covenant upon terms unequal] <hi>he gives it freely. R.</hi> Here it plainly appears what he means by terms equal and unequal, that it is as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick value, that a covenant of works are terms equal (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo he contradicts himſelf) <hi>i. e.</hi> man's perfect obedience in the ſaid covenant is ſo much for ſo much, as good as the reward, its a days-work in it ſelf worth the Wages promiſed, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith it was not; but now he ſaith, <hi>when the wages are more worth than the work, its on terms unequal;</hi> but the terms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal do not change the nature of a Bargain to make it none; for there are different Bargains, ſome better, and ſome worſe; but is the new law covenant a better Bargain or worſe than that of the covenant of Works? I take it to be much the harder, becauſe of the incapacity of the Covenantee: Man in the ſtate of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could much eaſier perform the condition of the covenant by perfect obedience than he can now in his lapſt ſtate perform the condition of the new law by imperfect, as may eaſily be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated from theſe mens Principles, they affirming, that <hi>the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the condition is not by natural power and ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> returns after this excurſion in ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>That the grace of Juſtification is purchaſed by Chriſt, is apparent by Rom.</hi> 3.24. The purchaſe of Grace (being free in the exerting its ſelf) is a contradiction; for what God doth by Grace, he doth <hi>ſua ſponte,</hi> without motion thereto by externals, and its meerly of his own good will and pleaſure, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will:</hi> Our Divines ſay, the covenant of Grace was not purchaſed, no not by Chriſt; but the way of the execution of this covenant was in and through Chriſt and his Purchaſe; that God might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe his Juſtice in the leaſt in exerting his Grace to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sinners. This Mr. <hi>H.</hi> oppoſeth and ſaith, <hi>If the Notion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41447:64"/>of</hi> free <hi>did ly in the conception our Divines ordinarily frame, then could it not be the fruit of Chriſt's purchaſe; for how can that which is purchaſed in their ſenſe, be free? Reſp.</hi> There's much more reaſon to ſay, how can that which is purchaſed in Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s ſenſe be free? There's leſs reaſon that a thing purchaſed in the Original and Fountain ſhould be free, than what is purchaſed in the Streams; therefore Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Anſwer cuts off his own legs; for if the Grace of God be not free becauſe it comes to us in and through Chriſt, and as the fruits of Chriſt's Purchaſe, then when this <hi>gratia dans</hi> is purchaſed how can that be free? He proceeds</p>
               <p>§ 13. <hi>Whereas it is this Grace certainly is the main fruit of Chriſt's Redemption,</hi> viz. <hi>that the new Covenant ſhould be eſtabliſhed. Reſp.</hi> Here it appears that he aſſerts, That the Grace whereby the New Covenant was made, was <hi>purchaſed grace, therefore not free</hi> by his own aſſertion, becauſe purchas'd, he ſays, Chriſt purchaſed the Grace of the New Covenant, therefore the covenant and all in it: So you ſee, he will have <hi>Purchaſe</hi> in our ſenſe, inconſiſtent with <hi>Free Grace;</hi> but <hi>purchaſe</hi> in his ſenſe more comprehenſive, to be Free Grace; but now he will have the <hi>freeneſs</hi> to ly in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing freely the works which ſhould make the reward due to him; To which I anſwer, its one thing to juſtifie for the Works wrought, and another to give them: Mr. <hi>H.</hi> calls this latter, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Grace and Sanctification; but Juſtification is declaring a man righteous by the ſaid Works.:</hi> Now if this Grace giving the condition be purchaſed, then Faith and Obedience was purchaſed by Chriſt, contrary to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> who ſaith <hi>it comes only as the gift of election:</hi> Hence it appears, that he will have Grace in the root to be purchaſed as to exhibition of the whole covenant, but not as to the performance of the main part of it.</p>
               <p>§. 13. <hi>See then how the Grace of God is made free in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, not upon the account that man cannot merit at God's hand, ſeeing God can be a debtor</hi> ex pacto regimine gratiae paterno. <hi>Reſp.</hi> God can be a Debtor to ſinful Man <hi>ex pacto,</hi> but then 1. Its upon <hi>pactum abſolutum,</hi> not ſuch a Covenant as makes man's works meritorious. 2. It is in and through Chriſt only that God is a Debtor in the way of Juſtice. 3. Its meerly <hi>Free Grace</hi> that hath brought about the Sinners Salvation by Chriſt, and not purchaſed. by himſelf. 4. God is not, nor ever will be a Debtor to ſinful Man, to juſtifie him for or by any works done by him either here or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. 5. Therefore whatever is the fruit of Free Grace in us, is free in reſpect of us on whom it is beſtowed; we do not merit or deſerve it in the leaſt, neither doth God reward any of his Children <hi>regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine foederis operum,</hi> ſuch as the New Law is and muſt be, which rewards us upon our own fulfilling the condition, <hi>But upon the account
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41447:64"/>here mentioned (before refuted) which is a moſt direct anſwer, becauſe we have ſhewed the indirectneſs and falſity of it— And I declare, that God's Abatement of Terms, and requiring a new Condition, is that which therefore makes it free, ſeeing it is tendred and obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out performance of the old. Reſp.</hi> The changing of Terms in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth not make it free, if God had changed the terms of the old covenant from perfect obedience to imperfect, it had not made it free, becauſe <hi>the condition is</hi> Works ſtill, for here the change is but a change from one compact to another, <hi>viz.</hi> Abatement of terms, and requiring new terms in the room. What if a man gets his Creditor, (of whom he complains he hath a hard Bargain) to make another Bargain upon eaſier terms, this is a favour indeed, but its juſtice, conſidering he had brought him under too hard terms before, but yet he doth not therefore give the commodity to him becauſe he allows him eaſier terms, but makes another Bargain upon other terms. So here, the new law is as much a Bargain as the other, tho upon ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier terms, which cannot be admitted. He proceeds to refute <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> about the works of the law, according to <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſenſe, which we ſhall examine when we come upon that Point.</p>
               <p>§. 14. We ſhall here gather the ſum of what according to truth, is to be aſſerted and defended againſt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and the reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the covenant of Works was not made with Man upon equal Terms, for his perfecteſt Obedience could never be equal with the promiſed Reward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the New-law Covenant is upon as equal Terms, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the Law, and they differ not in nature from the old covenant being works, if they differ in degree, its the covenant which hath made it ſo, and the Promiſe is as much a reward to the imperfection, as it was in the old to a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by God's conſtitution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God is free, and can be bound by none but himſelf, and its his Grace to covenant with the creature any way, but when God hath freely, without purchaſe, covenanted upon Terms of the creatures performance, he maketh himſelf a Debtor thereupon, let the Terms be perfect or imperfect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the pretended new-law covenant, where faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are the conditions, Man merits <hi>ex pacto,</hi> and God become a Debtor to him as much as he ſhould have bin to <hi>Adam</hi> if he had ſtood, hence the Apoſtle cannot mean <hi>juſtifying freely by grace</hi> in Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s ſenſe: But when we are ſaid to be <hi>juſtified freely by Gods grace,</hi> is meant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That it is of the pleaſure of God's Will, not upon any external Motive, no not of Chriſt's Death, that God exerts the Grace of Juſtification, <hi>he is gracious to whom he will.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41447:65"/>
               <p n="2">2. It is free in that the Object of it, upon whom it falleth, is a ſinner every way undone and miſerable, without Works or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, much leſs deſerving of this Grace, and this is the chief meaning of the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The providing, giving and beſtowing Chriſt and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is an high act of Grace, that a ſinner may be juſtified at the Bar of Divine Juſtice, that a ſinner, according to the Myſtery of his Will and gracious Diſpenſation may be fully acquitted thro Chriſt from the fiery Law, and diſcharged from all the charges thereof by the higheſt Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That as it was <hi>Free Grace</hi> every way to us, conſidered in our ſelves, therefore a Covenant of Promiſe without conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our part, hence abſolute; ſo it was a higher Covenant of Works to the Second <hi>Adam</hi> than ever the Firſt was under, and whereas Mr. <hi>H.</hi> objects and ſays, <hi>then we are juſtified by the law:</hi> I anſwer, 1. Where did he ever ſee Juſtification but by a Law. 2. He makes his to be by the new Law, which law we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be <hi>in rerum natura.</hi> 3. As we are juſtified by the Grace of God, ſo it is in Chriſt Jeſus, and a Believer in Chriſt needs no New Law to juſtifie him, he is juſtified by the Law in Jeſus Chriſt, and yet <hi>freely by Grace.</hi>

And its either commutative or diſtributive; commutative when perſons mutually perform their Duty to each other which they are bound
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41447:65"/>to by any Law, Covenant or Agreement, whether they be ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to inferiors, or inferiors to ſuperiors, or equals to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; a due conformity in obedience to a Law, is commutative Juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. done for Conſcience ſake, giving the Legiſlator his due; but if he is pleaſed not only to bind me to Duty, but promiſe a Reward upon performance, as I am bound to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo on the performance thereof God is bound to Reward; whence if Man had ſtood, the Covenant had bin fulfilled by way of commutation; its ſo between Magiſtrate and People, being bound together by Covenant, and each obſerving his Duty to other, its done by commutative Juſtice, and yet without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from the Authority and Grandeur, and juſt Prerogative of the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Diſtributive Juſtice or Righteouſneſs, is Magiſtratick, for the maintaining commutative Juſtice, by awarding it where its refuſed, or puniſhing the breach thereof, or in vindicating juſt perſons, which are falſly accuſed upon that account, to render to men judicially according to their works. All firſt conformity to Laws and Covenants is by commutative Juſtice; but upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the breach of the Rules thereof, Diſtributive Juſtice takes place. Hence God's execution of diſtributive Juſtice takes place upon the Fall of Men and Angels.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Again, Righteouſneſs is to be diſtinguiſhed in regard of the ſubject, Its either the Righteouſneſs of God, or the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Man; the Righteouſneſs of God is that which peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly belongs to himſelf, and that in his Sufficiency or Efficiency; the Juſtice appertaining to God in his Sufficiency, is his Eſſential Attribute, whereby he is eternally, infinitely and unchangeably righteous; this is not a righteouſneſs imputed unto us in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but a juſtifying righteouſneſs, it is the juſt God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth.</p>
               <p>§. 4. God's Juſtice in Efficiency is the execution thereof, that his eſſential Juſtice may ſhine forth to his Praiſe and Glory, The Execution of his Juſtice is a tranſient Act, and is either Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or execution of his Laws. God's Legiſlation is his acting from his Sovereign Will and Pleaſure in laying what Laws he pleaſeth on the creature; Laws are not purchaſed of God, any more than Grace, therefore they that talk in that manner, ſeem neither to underſtand Law or Grace. In God's Legiſlation, he hath given Man but one Law for Life, in the fulfilling where for not, Man is liable to be eternally ſaved or condemned; and God never made, nor Chriſt purchaſed any Remedying Law to amend the faults thereof, never abrogated or relaxt it, but it ſtands in its full Sanction preceptive, remunerative or vindictive.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41447:66"/>
               <p>§. 5. There neither is, nor ever was any juſtifying righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to Man, but what is the perfect and compleat righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Law, as imperfect righteouſneſs is renounced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by this Law; ſo it will not ſtand for Juſtification with any of God's Laws, neither is it Grace in God to relax his Law, he cannot deny himſelf in the perfection of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The execution of this Law upon Man ſince the Fall, is in a way of meer Juſtice, or in a way of exact Juſtice in conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency with Grace and Mercy. In a way of meer Juſtice, to the Glory thereof, on the Veſſels of Wrath; in a way of Juſtice in conſiſtency with all the deſigns of Grace and Mercy, by ſetting up a Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and providing ſuch a righteouſneſs in him, as might fully anſwer all the demands of the Law, which the Law ſhould accept and and impute to the Sinner, the Mediatorial and Surety Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and this is called <hi>the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> that we are made in Juſtification. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> denys it, but we ſhall endeavour to prove it.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Righteouſneſs of Man is to be diſtinguiſhed, Either as it is of his own performance for Juſtification, and ſo its the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law, and rejected by the Apoſtle; Or as its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by another, by Jeſus Chriſt for us, and this is called <hi>Our Righteouſneſs,</hi> and is ſo by real Imputation and Free Gift: <hi>This is our only Evangelical Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. Its alſo conſidered in reſpect of Juſtification before God, In this reſpect all Fallen Man's imperfect Righteouſneſs is filthy Rags; in reſpect of Sanctification they are the <hi>fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and accepted in Chriſt, the perſon being juſtified, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Believers are often denominated righteous in Scripture.</p>

               <p>§. 3. Not to impute a fault is to acquit, and of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as to impute righteouſneſs, and therefore where the Spirit of God ſpeaks of non imputation of ſin, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. it always therein aſſerts <hi>imputation of righteouſneſs;</hi> for he that is a ſinner and hath no ſin imputed to him, or charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him by the Law, is righteous, and found ſo by the Law, and indeed all proper imputation is by the Law, <hi>for Sin is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted where there is no law;</hi> therefore its properly the voice of the Law that imputes Sin or Righteouſneſs, where Actions or Claims of Right come to be queſtioned and tried; <hi>what the law ſaith, is ſaith to them that are under it</hi> for judgment and condemns

               <p>§. 4. To attribute, or aſcribe, are larger Terms than to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; when any thing is imputed to a perſon, its attributed and aſcribed, but every thing attributed or aſcribed, is not ſaid to be imputed, becauſe its ſpoken of in a Law-ſenſe, <hi>e. gr.</hi> we attribute Holineſs. Juſtice, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God, but do not ſay we impute them to God; we attribute Heat to Fire, hardneſs to Iron, but do not ſay, we impute Heat to Fire, or hardneſs to Iron, becauſe its naturally in them.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Legal Imputation of Sin or Righteouſneſs is either of that which is a Man's own, unto himſelf, or of that which primarily is his own and imputed unto another. The firſt is, when a Man bears his own Sin, or ſtands legally in his own righteouſneſs; upon the firſt the law condemns him, upon the other it juſtifies him; he is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt Judgment of the Law, found guilty or not, to have right to the Claim that he makes, or to have no right to his Claim to the Promiſe in a Law-Covenant. Hence imputation of righteouſneſs fixeth his right to the promiſed reward. Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin cuts off his right to the ſaid reward, and brings him under the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The ſecond ſort of legal Imputation is of a Man's own Sin or Righteouſneſs unto another. Its by way of tranſlation, and its either of Sin or of Righteouſneſs. Imputation of Sin by tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is when the Law imputes Sin to any other than the Sinner, ſo that by that Imputation thoſe others are legally made Sinners. And this Imputation is twofold by way of Attainder, or by way of Suretiſhip.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Imputation by way of Attainder is, when the whole Blood is charged with, and ſtained by the Sin of the actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor. Such was <hi>Achan</hi>'s Sin, ſuch alſo <hi>Adam</hi>'s Firſt Sin; his ſin was imputed to himſelf and all his Poſterity; he being not only a ſingle perſon, but a Publick Perſon. 1. Naturally, containing all Mankind in him. 2. Foederally, Becauſe God when he cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with him, covenanted with a Kind; he covenanted but with individuals when he covenanted with Angels. As <hi>Adam</hi> was when he ſtood, in reſpect of Mankind, ſohe was when he fell; Hence it was that all the Kind muſt needs fall in him, when Angels fell, each one fell but for himſelf, as each ſtood for himſelf; but it was not, it could not be ſo with Man; <hi>Adam</hi> therefore was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Repreſentative in reſpect of the number repreſented by him, that ever was, and <hi>all Mankind ſinned in him;</hi> Sin did not come upon us by Propagation only (tho a ſinner can propagate none but a ſinner) but by imputing <hi>Adam</hi>'s Firſt Sin to all his Poſterity,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41447:68"/>for <hi>judgment</hi> of imputation <hi>came upon all to condemnation</hi> of the whole kind; elſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s Firſt Sin ſhould affect us no more than any other of his ſins, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſins no more than the ſins of any other of our Progenitors; Hence <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin came upon us federally, and by way of Imputation as well as by Propagation and ſeminal Deſcent; for the Privation of the Image of God by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, which was his moral Death, was a Publick Loſs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be regained by any that have their ſtanding only in him. Hence every Natural Man is in him, ſtands under that firſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and therefore under that firſt Guilt; and as every Man by Nature ſtands under that Guilt, he alſo is under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Wrath and Curſe of the Law, <hi>Death paſſed upon all men, in that all have ſinned;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks but of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 16. and of death paſſing upon all by that ſin imputed by the law, as appears by the following word, <hi>that all died in Adam,</hi> the Apoſtle is expreſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. Undeſtand it of which Death you pleaſe ſpiritual or corporal that <hi>in Adam all died,</hi> it infers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily that <hi>Adam</hi> was a Publick Perſon; for we cannot be ſaid to live or dy in another's life or death, but as he is a Publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 49. we are ſaid <hi>to bear the image of the earthly, i. e.</hi> in his Fallen State, which ſhews that his Image was of a Publick Nature to all his Poſterity, and his loſs of God's Image, a Sin imputed to the whole kind.</p>
               <p>§. 8. I cannot ſtay to inſiſt largely on the proof of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, but is a Point of ſo great concern, that the denial of it overthrows the Goſpel in the true ſtate thereof; I ſhall only acquaint the Reader, That the <hi>Neonomians,</hi> together with the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> lay this denial in the foundation of their rotten Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Neonomian. <hi>We were not in</hi> Adam <hi>as a Publick Perſon, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative by a Covenant ſtanding, nor his ſin imputed to us further than we are guilty by a natural in being or derivation,</hi> Scr. G. D. p. 86, 87. 112, 113. End of Controv. 95.</p>
               <p>See his daring confidence. <hi>We were not in</hi> Adam <hi>as a publick Covenanter,</hi> I would ask whether God covenanted with <hi>Adam</hi> as the comprehender of all the Kind; if he did, then <hi>Adam</hi> was a Publick Covenantee inſtead of the whole Kind; and it appears in that the Covenant reached <hi>Eve</hi> then in him, when the covenant was made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2, and if the covenant was made with her in him, then why not, by the ſame reaſon, with all Mankind in him? He ſaith <hi>Adam's ſin is imputed no further than we are guilty;</hi> we ſay, <hi>we are not guilty any further than his ſin is imputed;</hi> its imputation of Sin makes us guilty, not guilt that makes imputation: He ſaith alſo, <hi>no further than by a natural in-being;</hi> what then, doth not a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41447:68"/>natural in-being in <hi>Adam</hi> at the time of his Covenant, make him a publick Covenanter, when the whole Nature was in him? and ſo we were federally in him, becauſe naturally; but ſee how the <hi>Socinians</hi> concur, Socin. <hi>They are greatly deceived who gather that all the poſterity of</hi> Adam <hi>ſinned in</hi> Adam <hi>the Parent, and truly to have deſerved the puniſhment of death— for ſins and merits, ſuch as are meerly perſonal, go not out of the perſon which hath ſinned, neither do Parents repreſent their Children. Altho there may be ſome hurt, and that not a little, to Children by their Parents ſin, as indeed it fell out in</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſin; but the very Sin and Merit of</hi> Adam <hi>was not communicated in, nor imputed to</hi> Adam's <hi>Poſterity, and hence the Posterity of</hi> Adam <hi>was not truly puniſhed for</hi> Adam's <hi>ſin, unleſs they imitated their Parents, Schlicting on Heb.</hi> 7.10. Whereas it appears plainly, by <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. that the merit paſſed upon all by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, <hi>for death paſſed upon all</hi> and the merit of Death cannot be without imputation of ſin, and it paſſed upon all that have not finned actually, even Infants, before they are capable of imitation of their Parents. Quakers, <hi>We do not aſcribe any whit of</hi> Adam<hi>'s guilt to men, till they make it theirs by the like acts of diſobedience.</hi> Barchl. This is alſo <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrine, <hi>That</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſin is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his Poſterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. Imputation is alſo by way of Suretiſhip, and it is when the Sins or Debts of one perſon, are by law charged upon, or imputed to another in order to the Salvation of the Principal or perſonal tranſgreſſor. Here it is always underſtood that the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Surety is as good and acceptable to the Law as that of the Principal. 2. That the Surety cannot become Pay-maſter in Law, unleſs he take the Debt or Sin upon him inſtead of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tranſgreſſor he muſt be charged as tranſgreſſor, elſe the Law can make no demand upon him. 3. He muſt freely offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Surety, no perſon can be forced in any caſe to be Surety for another. 4. When he hath engaged himſelf in Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the law takes him perſon for perſon, the principal Debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his, and his righteouſneſs and payment becomes the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals in a real legal commutation, here is no natural or moral Change, but ſponſorial and legal, nay, no logical change, <hi>i. e.</hi> one relation is not changed into another, the Surety into the Principal, nor Principal into the Surety; but in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law the Principal Debt becomes the Surety's, and the Surety's Payment is the Principals. whereupon the Principal in reſpect of that Sin or Debt for which Satisfaction is made, hath the diſcharge in full, and is as perfectly righteous as to that, as the Surety himſelf; he is not it may be ſo rich and honourable as his Surety, but in reſpect of the Debt ſatisfied, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41447:69"/>Law hath no more to ſay to him than to the Surety, An <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> fetcheth a Priſoner, and with him many more out of <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> owing Five or Ten Pounds a piece, this little money being all that's owing in the World by the poor Man, when diſcharged the Law hath no more to ſay to him than to the <hi>Alderman,</hi> and he is as righteous in the eye of the Law, tho he will not pretend to be ſo great and ſo rich, or a ranſomer of others out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the Alderman himſelf is.</p>
               <p>§. 10. He that bears the ſins of others muſt be a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Publick Perſon, that muſt perſonate or bear the perſons of them whoſe ſins he bears, and muſt be either ſubſtituted by the Court, or if by ſome other, he muſt be allowed to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and able to make Payment, muſt be accepted and dealt with in the name and upon the account of the other, and becomes a Debtor or Tranſgreſſor in and for the perſon he doth repreſent in Court, and becomes a Delinquent in the eye of the Law, the Law imputing ſin to him makes him ſin, becauſe he is ſuppoſed to owe nothing on his own account; he that doth <hi>in foro</hi> repreſent one or more, and ſtands not, nor acts for himſelf, but others, is a publick Perſon and Repreſentative, as a Burgeſs or Citizen in Parliament, and they that he repreſents are ſaid to act in and by him. Its a contradiction to common ſenſe and reaſon, to ſay, that he that ſtands legally or civilly in the place of another, to act his part, and in his name, ſhould not be a publick Perſon, but men will throw down common ſenſe and reaſon to eſtabliſh their own fond Conceits and Errors.</p>
               <p>§. 11. The difference between Imputation by way of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and by way of Suretiſhip is, that this Imputation is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Salvation of the Sinner, but that is as to legal ſingle effects only to the Sinners Deſtruction. 2. That in this Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the way of Suretiſhip, as there is Imputation of the ſinners ſin to the Surety, ſo there is a re-imputation of the Surety's righteouſneſs to the ſinner, but in Imputation of Sin by way of Attainder, there's no re-imputation of righteouſneſs to the firſt ſinner. 3. The Imputation doth differ in the manner of tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In Imputation of ſin by way of Attainder, ſin is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the Repreſentative to the Repreſented; but in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by way of Suretiſhip, ſin is transferred from the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Repreſentative, and that's the reaſon, that tho we are fitly ſaid to ſin in <hi>Adam</hi> becauſe he was our Repreſentative; yet its not ſo fitly ſaid that Chriſt ſinned in us, becauſe that we were never Repreſentatives to Chriſt; but its fitly ſaid, we are righteous in Chriſt, becauſe he is our Repreſentative, and that we ſatisfied in Chriſt, which ſaying doth not rob Chriſt of his Glory
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41447:69"/>of Satisfaction, but gives it him, affirming that Chriſt ſatisfied, and for us, and that God is well pleaſed with us through him; If a man that hath owed Money to <hi>A.</hi> and paid him by his Surety <hi>B.</hi> be charged that he owes <hi>A.</hi> ſo much Money; he denys it, and ſaith, I paid you by <hi>B.</hi> doth he ſpeak true or falſe? doth he not ſpeak properly? doth he hereby ſay, I paid you by my own Money? No, he only ſaith, that <hi>B.</hi> paid for me my Debt with his Money: But we ſee how <hi>Neonomians</hi> will pick quarrel with common ſenſe and reaſon, as they do in their denial of this high and fundamental Point <hi>Of Imputation of Sin to Chriſt,</hi> and charge it for an Error to ſay, <hi>we ſatisfied in Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Sect. 1. THat <hi>Righteouſneſs is imputed to the Juſtification of a ſinner before God,</hi> is held on all ſides; but the great Controverſie lies here, What Righteouſneſs is it? Is it our own inherent righteouſneſs, or the righteouſneſs of another? the <hi>Neonomians</hi> with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, its our own which is the formal cauſe of our Juſtification; we ſay, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is the material cauſe of our Juſtification, and Imputation the formal. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> excludes the Merits of Chriſt from any of the eſſential cauſes, and makes it only <hi>modum efficientis,</hi> ſomething in the hand of the efficient, it may be an inſtrument, but at the beſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41447:70"/>its but <hi>cauſa miniſtrans,</hi> by way of efficiency, but enters not that effect as any eſſential Cauſe. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would find out ſome little Difference between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and himſelf, but its ſo little that he can hardly render it viſible. The Counſel of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>There is only one formal Cauſe of Juſtification which is the Righteouſneſs of God, not whereby he is Righteous, but whereby he makes us Righteous;</hi> viz. <hi>which he hath beſtowed on us, whereby we are renewed in the Spirit of our minds, and are not only reputed Juſt, but are truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Righteous and are ſo</hi> — and it follows, <hi>In this is the Juſtification of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, whilſt for the Merit of that moſt Holy Paſſion, the Love of God is ſhed abroad by the Holy Ghoſt in the Hearts of them that are juſtified, and inherent in them, whence in Juſtification it ſelf with Remiſſion of Sins this is together with it infuſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Seſs.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> agrees with them, that our inherent Righteouſneſs is the formal Cauſe, and that it is for the Merits of Chriſt, that this Righteouſneſs is wrought in us, that therefore it's called the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in Defence of the Doctrine of the <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>Tr.</hi> ſays, the State of this whole Controverſie may be reduced to this one Queſtion. <hi>Whether or no the formal Cauſe of Abſolute Juſtification be Righteouſneſs inhering in us?</hi> Which he endeavours to maintain in the Affirmative. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would have ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in that they ſay Juſtification is by Infuſion of Righteouſneſs, whereas he ſaith Infuſion of Grace is Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Juſtification is by Grace infuſed; of the two, I take the <hi>Papiſt</hi> to be righteſt in conſtitutive Juſtification, and to have leſs of Merit in it; whereas Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Juſtification is by Sanctification wrought firſt, which carries more of Merit and leſs of Grace, for here Juſtification appears at firſt ſight to be <hi>ex condigno</hi> the good qualification of the Subject. Yea the Papiſts go further then Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for he will not have Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs nor Remiſſion of Sins to have any place in Juſtification, which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> own to be Parts of our Juſtification, for the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> do Anathametize thoſe only that teach, that a Man is juſtified on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs and Remiſſion of Sins, without inherent Grace and Charity; yea I do not find that this <hi>Neonomian</hi> Doctrine comes any whit ſhort of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of Juſtification, nay it out-does it in daring Contradiction to the the Goſpel.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41447:71"/>trifle for about Infuſion] <hi>and this is the formal Cauſe, we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied alſo by the Redemption of Chriſt, and this is the meritorious Cauſe, Laſtly, we are juſtified by Faith in the Blood of a Propitiator, and this the diſpoſing Cauſe;</hi> from hence we may learn that every ſincere <hi>Neonomian</hi> is a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in the Point of Juſtification, and that the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Doctrine of Juſtification is the Middle-way between the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> See but a Taſte, how the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> fall in with this Doctrine of Juſtification by Works. <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Works and Faith are equally required to Juſtifie, Works of the Law are excluded as done by us, to be juſtified by Grace is to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Regeneration, which cannot exclude Works wrought by Grace, ſince the Law gives not Power to obey and ſo fall ſhort of Juſtification, there's Power under the Goſpel whereby the Law comes to be fulfilled inwardly, Works through the Power of the Spirit is a Condition upon which Life is propoſed under the New Covenant. It appears from divers Scriptures, that the Apoſtle excludes only our own Righteouſneſs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Righteouſneſs of the Law from being neceſſary to Juſtification,</hi> Barcl. <hi>Socinian, There was never but one way of Juſtification by Faith—This Faith is nothing elſe but under the hope of Eternal Life to obey the Commands of Chriſt, and this we apprehend to be underſtood in Scripture where-ever we read of Salvation promiſed to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt.</hi> Socin. de offic.

Now let us ſee how Conſonant our <hi>Neonomians</hi> be to this Fraternity in the Doctrine, we'll take it from Mr. <hi>H.</hi> one of the honeſteſt of the Pack and freeſt from Juggling. <hi>Medeocr.</hi> p. 16, 17. <hi>Our Works do not Merit, becauſe they are not perfect</hi> [i. e. <hi>therefore do not Merit as related to the Old-Covenant, but Merit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,</hi> ex pacto <hi>in relation to the New-law-Covenant</hi>] <hi>but we are juſtified by Works as we are by Faith, becauſe Faith juſtifies only as productive of Works</hi> [thence you ſee he placeth the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith in it ſelf as a Work done, and that it juſtifies only ſo, and hath no more juſtifying Nature or End then the Fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of] — <hi>It is Faith as productive of Works, that receive the Reward of perfect Righteouſneſs [in that this imperfect ſtands in the Room of perfect] but we are ſtill to remember for Chriſts ſake.</hi> [Bellarmine <hi>remembred that and the Council of</hi> Trent] <hi>God judgeth and will judge all Men according to the Goſpel, thoſe who perform the Condition of it,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41447:71"/>he accounts and pronounceth righteous; thoſe whom he accounts righteous are juſtified; I will add that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt which is the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, and always comes under the efficient, cannot by the ſame reaſon be the formal and material cauſe of it: It is not infuſion of righteouſneſs with the</hi> Papiſt <hi>which is our Sanctification, nor the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs with the</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>which is not to be underſtood</hi> in genere cauſae efficiente, <hi>nor Remiſſion of Sin with</hi> Proteſtant <hi>and</hi> Papiſt [you ſee here how far he goes beyond the <hi>Papiſt</hi>] <hi>but to impute to a perſon his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the New Covenant for Righteouſneſs, or pronouncing him righteous according to that Covenant, is the formal cauſe of his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Med. p.</hi> 46. Here is to be remarkt that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth peremptorily exclude from our Juſtification the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and Remiſſion of Sins, and places the whole of it in imputation of our own works for righteouſneſs, as active obedience.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Theſe Men do as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the reſt, make our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Holineſs in Sanctification, to be that very righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified. Take Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s words wherein he fully expreſſeth Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s ſenſe in differing from the <hi>Papiſt</hi> about Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Herein lieth the true difference between Juſtification and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: In Sanctification we are made holy, righteous and good, by the infuſion of thoſe Graces into us; but in Juſtification we are only accounted and declared ſuch; in the one the change is but relative, and in the other real.</hi> Come in <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſhake this Friend by the hand as one of you, you have quarrelled with the Pulpits a great while, and now you may aſcend them your ſelves when you pleaſe, and be not ſo angry at them, for you ſhall not hear theſe men call your Doctrine <hi>Popiſh</hi> any more; but you'll hear them call all men that are not of your Opinion <hi>Antinomians</hi> briſkly. See now the depth of this diſtinction. <hi>Juſtification is not by infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sanctification, but yet Juſtification is by Sanctification infuſed.</hi> Is it not much more rational to ſay, that Juſtification is by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man righteous that was not ſo before; for Juſtification of a ſinner muſt be ſuch: Beſides, <hi>is it not much more Evvngelical as to juſtifying the ungodly?</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith. But theſe Men ſay, <hi>We are firſt made righteous</hi> [that is godly] <hi>and then pardoned</hi> [he ſhould have ſaid <hi>juſtified,</hi> for his Juſtification comes in between his ſanctifying Righteouſneſs and Pardon] <hi>and not on the contrary, firſt pardoned, and then righteous,</hi> Mr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Were ever ſuch Abſurdities aſſerted by Men of Reaſon?</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are firſt made righteous, and <hi>quatenus</hi> made ſo, are ſanctified and not juſtified; therefore Juſtification makes no man righteous, but finds them ſo; but it declares Men, what? what it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41447:72"/>finds them, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſanctified. Hence to declare a Man ſanctified is his Juſtification: and I pray now, how comes in Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. <hi>cauſa formalis?</hi> how doth Juſtification differ formally <hi>(nam ad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam pertinet proprium &amp; differentia)</hi> from Sanctification, when Imputation, or God's accounting a man holy and ſanctified is his Juſtification? Is not God's Judgment according to Truth? Is it not certain that God accounts every thing to be as it is, a holy man holy? If this be all your Juſtification, its no more than as God juſtified at the Creation, he ſaw <hi>that every thing was good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If we are firſt made righteous, and then juſtified becauſe we are ſo, its <hi>meritum ex condigno,</hi> whereon we are juſtified, all the World cannot hinder it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>First righteous, and then pardoned;</hi> What ſenſe is in that? for a righteous perſon needs no Pardon in that thing wherein he is righteous; for therein to be righteous and want Pardon, is to ſpeak Daggers, and the abſurdeſt contradiction in the World.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Well, But why muſt our <hi>Neonomians</hi> be pardoned when righteous and juſtified before? becauſe indeed their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtification by it is not worth a Fig by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith, —<hi>for ſince ſubordinate Goſpel Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is an imperfect righteouſneſs, conſiſtent with manifold failings and infirmities, therefore notwithſtanding that, there's need of pardon, and that continually:</hi> This is alſo Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Doctrine, therefore I need not tranſcribe his very words which are to this purpoſe in many places. <hi>Reſp.</hi> I find they are not fully agreed about the intervening Righteouſneſs between Chriſt and us, what to call it. Mt. <hi>Cl.</hi> calls it ſubordinate, and ſo doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> liking not that Name ſo well, had rather call it co-ordinate; but I know not from the Notion of the thing duly conſidered, why they may not go one ſtep further, and call it the Principal or ſupream juſtifying righteouſneſs, for that which hath the principal place in any thing aſcribed to it, is the principal, but our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath the principal place in the thing aſcribed to it, which is Juſtification, therefore its the chief and ſupream righteouſneſs: For they ſay we are juſtified by the imputation of this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only, and by no other, therefore all conducing righteouſneſſes to the introducing this, are ſubordinate to it. Again, That which hath its place only in the external cauſes, and in the modality of their operation as to the production of the effect, is much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the eſſential cauſes that enter the very effect, and are conſtitutive to it, but Chriſt's Righteouſneſs by theſe men is no more, and therefore muſt be a ſubordinate righteouſneſs to ours; ours being <hi>cauſa formalis juſtificationis,</hi> an eſſential cauſe, Chriſt's
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41447:72"/>being but <hi>cauſa protarch.</hi> a remote cauſe, adjuvant to the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, therefore the righteouſneſs of Chriſt can have no more than a remote cauſality in purchaſing the New Law, by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof we are juſtified, which is no better indeed than <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> its <hi>in ordine ad</hi> the juſtifying righteouſneſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubordinate to it. 2. He ſaith, <hi>This ſubordinate Goſpel Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is an imperfect righteouſneſs.</hi> Truly I am ſorry for it, that Goſpel Righteouſneſs ſhould be imperfect; I doubt there's little dependance upon it, ſince the righteouſneſs of the law that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us is perfect, its little likelihood that an imperfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould ſave us from it; ay, but they will ſay, its Chriſt's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs muſt ſave us from the perfect righteouſneſs of the law condemning us. Say you ſo? and therefore why ſhould not this righteouſneſs of Chriſt have the honour of juſtifying us? it ſeems we are ſaved by Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and juſtified by our own, as if Juſtification were not Salvation: But is our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-righteouſneſs imperfect? this is no Goſpel, for its ill News; I muſt tell theſe men its a rotten foundation they build upon, and their Building will drop not being built on Chriſt, <hi>the Corner Stone</hi> in Juſtification. 3. He ſaith, <hi>Its imperfect, conſiſtent with many failings and infirmities. Reſp.</hi> I pray how comes this to paſs? is it from the Legiſlator that conſtituted ſuch a Law, whoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is obedience conſiſtent with ſin; or is it from the Operator or Worker under this Law? if from the former, then the Law makes it in fault, if there be any; but if he hath made a law with ſuch condition of obedience conſiſtent with ſin, then perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch is no ſin, nor needs a Pardon, <hi>for ſin is the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the law</hi> the ſubject is under: Now if Believers are under the New Law for Juſtification, and perform there what's requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what need have they of a Pardon from a righteouſneſs bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from another law? If it be from the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the fault and defect of the operator of righteouſneſs, that his righteouſneſs is not the performance of the condition of the New Law, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, then this New Law cannot juſtifie him, our <hi>Neonomians,</hi> in this Point, will be on <hi>Scilla</hi> or <hi>Charybdis</hi> in ſpite of the World. In a word, 1. That righteouſneſs that cannot juſtifie us at the Bar of the old Law, or Covenant of Works, is no juſtifying righteouſneſs, but none of our own righteouſneſs, New Law or other, will not juſtifie us at the Bar of the Covenant of Works by the <hi>Neonomians</hi> own confeſſion, therefore we cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any ſuch righteouſneſs. 2. Again, that righteouſneſs which needs pardon is no juſtifying righteouſneſs, but is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the law, for whatever is pardoned is condemned by the law firſt, neither is that perſon juſtified, who by the law is unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41447:73"/>Pardon being an eſſential part of Juſtification in Mens Courts, where many Indictments ly againſt a Man, if he be quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſome, and not of all, he is not diſcharged as juſtified; but here its worſe, I do not find that at the New Law Bar a man (as they ſay) juſtified, is quite diſcharged from any Indictment at all, for there's none fully pardoned; wherefore our <hi>Neonomians</hi> ſay that their Juſtification is not perfect in this life. So Mr. <hi>Cl. Our Juſtification in this world is not perfect and compleat, &amp;c.</hi> p. 18.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith, <hi>There's a twofold guilt, Legal and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, Legal Guilt is an obligation to eternal puniſhment; this is fully</hi> pardoned in Juſtification, <hi>and can never return again, becauſe Chriſt hath taken it all upon himſelf, and made full ſatisfaction to his Father's Juſtice for it, but Goſpel-guilt which is</hi> an obligation to Goſpel-Puniſhment, <hi>i. e. fatherly chaſtiſements for ſins after Juſtification, returns upon commiſſion of new ſins, and is removed upon repentance, ſometimes wholly, ſometimes in part.</hi> This is alſo Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The diſtinction is naught, for we deny any Evangelical Guilt, Evangelical Guilt, Threat or Puniſhment is a Bull, a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Contradiction, if we know what Goſpel is, and they that will be ignorant, and call this Aſſertion <hi>Antinomian</hi> Poyſon, let them be ignorant ſtill, I thank God for the knowledge of the Goſpel ſo far, as that it is quite contrary to Guilt, Threat and Puniſhment, or Obligation to it in the true legal ſenſe thereof: Likewiſe he ſhould have diſtinguiſhed of Guilt as uſual, <hi>reatus culpae,</hi> and <hi>reatus paenoe,</hi> the firſt properly Guilt, and that in <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio legis, vel judicio conſcientiae,</hi> if a Man be <hi>ſub reatu culpae judicio legis,</hi> as they ſay the juſtified ones are, he is unjuſtified, for the law cannot juſtifie a man and declare him guilty, <hi>i. e.</hi> not guilty and guilty at the ſame time. Obligation to Puniſhment is not Guilt in the true ſenſe of it; for we ſay a man caſt in Court is guilty of the charged Fault, and therefore the Law binds him over to Puniſhment. We never ſay a Man is <hi>guilty</hi> of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but <hi>deſerves,</hi> he is found guilty, and therefore the Sentence of the Law binds him to Puniſhment; but he ſaith, <hi>Legal Guilt is fully pardoned in Juſtification:</hi> Pardon is always of a fault, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not <hi>punire:</hi> but is ſin pardoned fully in Juſtification as to an obligation to eternal puniſhment, then 1. Pardon is included in Juſtification, contrary to what he aſſerts in the foregoing Page. 2. Juſtification is perfect and compleat, ſo far as the taking off eternal puniſhment. 3. He cannot but own this to be the main part of Juſtification at leaſt, and this it ſeems is owing to the full ſatisfaction made by Chriſt to the Juſtice of God, our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the New Law hath nothing to do here in the matter of Eternal State: Where are we now? what a Juſtification is this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41447:73"/>by the New Law, wherein our eternal ſtate is not concerned. Well! but our Juſtification in this life is not yet perfect; not by Chriſt becauſe he takes off only eternal puniſhment, but temporal he hath left to us to remove by Repentance, performing the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the New Law, I hope this righteouſneſs falling in to help Chriſt's, it will produce perfect Juſtification. No it wont, this righteouſneſs takes away our Sins and Puniſhment wholly but ſometimes. and ſometimes only in part, and what's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? where's the fault? why it falls upon this New Law, which is always fulfilling and never fulfilled; it will never juſtifie any one till the laſt day, and it cannot do it then without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs of the Old Law.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Let's take Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s Definition of Juſtification into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration a little, He ſaith, <hi>The Definition of Juſtification ſo far as it relates to God is thus, Juſtification is an act of God whereby he accounts us righteous at preſent, and treats us as ſuch, and will ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare and pronounce us ſo at the laſt day of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> He ſhould have told us what act of God, whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent or tranſient, whether an act of Grace or Juſtice, or both, he ſhould have told us the object of that act, whether a meer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or a righteous perſon? he will tell us anon, its a righteous perſon, and he ſaith, <hi>accounting him ſo at preſent,</hi> if this <hi>accounting him</hi> be in a law ſenſe, its but Imputation at moſt, and this is that, and all that he doth at preſent, he finds them holy and righteous, and judgeth them to be as they be; but doth not God declare them righteous at preſent, neither <hi>in foro Legis,</hi> nor <hi>in foro Evangelii,</hi> nor <hi>in foro conſcientiae?</hi> in none of theſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when then? the very Sentence of Juſtification is not till the laſt day; ſo that indeed there is none juſtified till then; for a ſuſpended ſentence keeps the perſon (whatever Opinion the Judge hath of him) under the Law, in Priſon, and in continual fear of Condemnation; ſo that they are all the day long for fear of Death ſubject to Bondage.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Hence he infers two things. 1. <hi>That Juſtification while we are in this life is but partial, imperfect and incompleat, and that we ſhall not obtain fully compleat, entire and final Justification for all the effects of ſin till the Day of Judgment.</hi> To which I anſwer, Where there is but an imperfect, partial Juſtification there muſt be a partial Condemnation; it cannot be denied but the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys it, and ſaith, <hi>there's no condemnatien to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The law knows no ſuch thing, a man is either perfectly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſame thing, or perfectly condemned, there's no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um betwixt Juſtification and Condemnation.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41447:74"/>
               <p n="3">3. If the New Law do not perfectly juſtifie a perſon, then it condemns too at the ſame time, that when ever the Parator of righteouſneſs takes himſelf to be juſtified, he is bound to believe himſelf condemned alſo; and whether will ſtand good at the laſt Day he knows not, either his Juſtification or Condemnation.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>Sect. 1. MR. <hi>Cl</hi>'s Second Inference is, <hi>That Juſtification doth not properly conſiſt in Pardon;</hi> afterward he ſaith, <hi>a man is firſt righteous and then pardoned;</hi> to which we have ſpoken ſomething. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes a fearful pudder about this Point, we will a little inſpect his Notions, <hi>Mediocr. p.</hi> 44, 55. <hi>Our Divines do generally place Juſtification in remiſſion of Sins, and ſo do the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, <hi>and ſo did I my ſelf. Reſp.</hi> Remiſſion of Sins is upon good grounds placed in Juſtification as an eſſential part of the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sinner, and I can boldly deny that ſinner to be juſtified, whoſe ſins are not forgiven, and to ſeparate them is as poſſible as to ſeparate <hi>homo &amp; animal rationale.</hi> The Law, any Law, nay your New Law cannot juſtifie a ſinner and declare him righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unleſs in that very act of declaring him righteous his ſins are taken away <hi>in foro legis,</hi> and this is God's Remiſſion (tho not Man's) for <hi>his ways are not as mans;</hi> and whereas Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes remiſſion of ſins to be a benefit after Juſtification as an effect of it, we ſay it is a benefit in Juſtification, and the firſt thing in it in Nature; for its impoſſible any one ſhould ſtand righteous in the eye of any Law, that ſtands chargeable as a tranſgreſſor thereof. <hi>But remiſſion muſt not</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>H.</hi>) <hi>be the formal reaſon of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Reſp.</hi> The form of an Act, and the formal reaſon of that Act are two things, the material reaſon of Juſtification is righteouſneſs, and the formal cauſe is imputation of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Juſtification comes in as the acquitting Sentence, oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41447:74"/>(as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith) <hi>to condemnation, which</hi> ex natura rei, <hi>muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally carry in it forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> He proceeds, <hi>To forgive a mans ſins and declare him rigeteous are two inconſiſtencies one with another in the ſame reſpect. Reſp. Cujus contrarium verum;</hi> in Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Sinner they are moſt conſiſtent, and inſeparable, that in declaring a ſinful man righteous his ſins are alſo done away; its true, in mans way of Pardon there is ſome inconſiſtency, becauſe his is by diſpenſing with his Law, but God's way of forgiveneſs is in and through the ſatisfaction of his Law; but I muſt tell him, that here no Man is looked upon as righteous in the eye of man's law that hath tranſgreſſed it, till he is firſt pardoned, —<hi>and therefore when God pronounceth a man juſt, it is according to the law of faith, when he pardons his ſins it is in reſpect of the law of works. Reſp.</hi> Here are two Bars, now he ſaith elſewhere, <hi>he likes not two bars,</hi> I would fain know now at which of theſe Bars a ſinner is moſt juſtified, either by the law of Works, where all his ſins are forgiven, and therefore conſequently muſt be made right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous; or at the Bar of the New Law where he ſaith, <hi>the man is declared juſt, but imperfectly ſo,</hi> and therefore goes away with his ſins upon his Back to the Law of Works to have them pardoned: Is it not pretty Divinity then, to ſay a man is declared righteous firſt at the Bar of the Law of Faith, and then all the Bed-role of his ſins are pardoned at the Bar of the Law of Works?</p>
               <p>§. 2. He comes to diſtinguiſh of Remiſſion, <hi>Its either condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and univerſal, as it lies in the Covenant, and is the purchaſe of Chriſt, or actual, as it lies in application thereof to particular perſons upon performance of the conditions. Reſp.</hi> This Diſtinction is a great Point among the <hi>Neonomians,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes much uſe of it in his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption,</hi> the Story is this, They feign that God find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inconvenience of the law of works, by reaſon of the Fall, his Son ſatisfied not the law broken, but compounded with God as Lord above Law, that this law ſhould be relapſed; ſaith Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith <hi>that it might be abrogated,</hi> which is more rational, tho it is more downright <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> which ſcares Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Chriſt accordingly dies to purchaſe a New Law, with condition of imperfect obedience inſtead of the perfect, the propounding or promulgating this New Law to all the world is <hi>univerſal remiſſion,</hi> it being the offer of Remiſſion on the condition of imperfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all the World; in this ſence all the world, they ſay, is redeemed, juſtified and forgiven before they perform that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now, if any others, beſides <hi>Neonomians</hi> ſhould talk at this rate, they would be in danger of being taken up and ſent to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> for Madmen. As if a Company, ſuppoſe the <hi>E. India,</hi> ſet up their Bills for a Sale at a certain time after prefixt, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41447:75"/>Prizes; if one or all ſhould run about the City before the day of Sale prefixt, and ſay, they had ſold their Goods at ſuch and ſuch Prizes, all men will call them Liars or Madmen. So, becauſe God proffers eternal life upon performance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, therefore all men are redeemed, juſtified and forgiven, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſay they, <hi>conditionally,</hi> and that's not at all till they perform the condition; but <hi>Neonomians</hi> may talk non-ſence, and contradict by the New Law, yea and aſſert Juſtification before Faith, while they call others <hi>Antinomians</hi> who do it, when they are the greateſt <hi>Antinomians</hi> themſelves in the World. Now the noiſe that they make about the Merit and Purchaſe of Chriſt, its no more than his purchaſing the New Law of Works, and they are juſtified by the performing the condition of the new law for the ſake of Chriſt's Merits, its only becauſe, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tells us, <hi>that Chriſt by his Merits was an efficient of the New Law;</hi> ſo that generally, in all they talk of Chriſt's Satisfaction and Merits, there's ſome cheat or Amphibology. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> indeed ſpeaks out moſt honeſtly, in as good as telling us, that <hi>Neonomians</hi> are <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the Point of Juſtification. But to proceed,</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>When Divines ſay we can do nothing our ſelves for procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciliation and remiſſion, it is to be underſtood of conditional, univerſal remiſſion. Reſp.</hi> What Divines underſtand ſo? they are not the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> its only the <hi>Neonomians</hi> who are no <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Point of Juſtification: Theſe Divines underſtand only, that we cannot purchaſe the conditional, univerſal Remiſſion, the Purchaſe of that it ſeems was peculiar to Chriſt; but as for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Remiſſion, theſe men purchaſe, and Reconciliation too; Chriſt purchaſed that we might purchaſe, and tho he purchaſed the new law, and promulgation of it, yet he purchaſed not the performance of the Condition; for ſuch hard terms they will keep Chriſt too that he may not entrench on their Dignity.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>Conditional Pardon is antecedent to a mans Juſtification, and contained in our redemption, in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveneſs of ſins. Reſp.</hi> Conditional Pardon is none, its no more than the offer of a Bargain to any that will come to the Terms: As if I ſhould offer to Lett my Houſe for ſo much Money by a Bill over the Door, and then ſay, I have Lett my Houſe to all the men in <hi>London.</hi> And its ſtrange, that all men ſhould be pardoned and redeemed and not juſtified, but I think <hi>R. B.</hi> ſaith <hi>they are juſtified,</hi> and I am ſure they may be as well juſtified as pardoned. However he owns Pardon in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and this antecedent to Faith; ſure then Juſtification (which with us) is inſeparable from Faith, is not <hi>Antinomianiſm.</hi> And is it poſſible any Divine ſhould abuſe the Scripture ſo, as to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41447:75"/>wreſt it to ſuch a ſenſe, that the Apoſtle ſhould by Remiſſion there, mean ſuch as is contained in univerſal Redemption, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. whereas the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Redemption in particular application, for the words preceeding, <hi>v.</hi> 13. are <hi>who hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> verſe 14. <hi>In whom we have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Actual Remiſſion is ſubſequent to Juſtification, for we muſt be ſuppoſed firſt to have performed the condition, and be pronounced righteous, and then pardoned, when there is no remiſſion then but doth go before or follow Juſtification, it cannot be made the very act it ſelf of Juſtification. Reſp.</hi> Let us try a little for it: 1. He ſaith, <hi>actual remiſſion is ſubſequent to Juſtification;</hi> now we are come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s. road, he ſeems not to be ſo well acquainted with the Myſtery of the <hi>antecedent remiſſion,</hi> and its ſo indeed, for it ſeems it is but potential remiſſion, its not actual, nay its a contingent <hi>potentia,</hi> there is pardon, and none pardoned, the meaning is, that the New Law made all the world pardonable upon a contingent condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We find a pretty odd invention, here's Juſtification beſet with Remiſſion, before and behind, and yet no Remiſſion in it; a man pardoned and not juſtified, and then juſtified and not pardoned; and truly, if this ſubſequent Pardon be no better than the antecedent, the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Juſtification is deſtitute of Pardon before and behind too. I wonder all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines do not nauſeate ſuch Whims as theſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But is it poſſible that he ſhould ſay, <hi>that pardon cannot be made the act of Juſtification;</hi> ſurely theſe forget what they are talking of, is it not conditional Pardon the New Law promiſeth, how can there be Juſtification by the New Law of him that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the condition, but by pardon in the act of Juſtification; for if the New Law ſaith, <hi>believe and thou ſhalt be pardoned,</hi> the new law when it juſtifies the Believer muſt pardon him, and now we have help at a dead lift, juſt now it was, that tho our new law could juſtifie, yet it could not pardon; but we are fain to go to the old Law Bar to fetch a Pardon, and trouble Chriſt about it too, but we have found now that the new law can pardon; for if it pardon all the World conditionally, it can pardon particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons actually, when they perform the conditions.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H.</hi> defines Juſtification thus, <hi>It is an act of God's free Grace, whereby God imputes to every ſound Believer his Faith for Righteouſneſs, upon the account of Chriſt's Satisfaction and Merit, giving him Pardon and Life as the benefits of it.</hi> Right. of God, p. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> For the Genus he refers the proof to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> but he repreſenteth himſelf ſhort of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> who ſay, <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an act of God's free Grace unto ſinners,</hi> for which they quote <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 24, 25. Now Juſtification barely conſidered as ſuch, is an act of Juſtifice, unleſs it be ſpoken with this condition, and I find Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Notion of it will not bear this connection; for his Juſtification is of a perſon only, that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively righteous, our Juſtification and his are diſtinguiſhed <hi>toto genere,</hi> for he ſaith, the object of his Juſtification is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſon, to ſuch an one Juſtification is due; its no act of Grace to juſtifie ſuch an one, a ſound Believer. By <hi>Faith</hi> he means Repentance and New Obedience, as the conditional terms of the New Law, which being performed by any one, he is not juſtified by free Grace, but legally he can challenge it by the New Law.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41447:76"/>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>This Faith and New Obedience, tho imperfect, God accepts in the room of perfect righteouſneſs, not accounting it perfect. Reſp.</hi> It is abſurd to ſay, God accepts it in the room of perfect; for if ſo, it ſhould come in, in place and room of the perfect in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, God putting out that condition, and putting in this, but this imperfect comes as terms in another law, ſo it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not the terms of another. 2. No, why ſhould God account it perfect if it be as they ſay, but the law of God is perfect, and tho God judgeth the righteouſneſs morally imperfect in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the righteouſneſs of the firſt law, yet he muſt reckon it a perfect condition of the new law, it being as much as the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and therefore a condition perfectly performed, for elſe it can never be pleaded or imputed at its Bar; but he ſaith, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts it, if he accept it its by its ſelf, or for the ſake of a better righteouſneſs; now no law can accept any righteouſneſs by its ſelf, but it muſt be eſteemed by its ſelf to be a full righteouſneſs compleatly to anſwer the demands of the ſaid law; if the law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it for or in the righteouſneſs of another, it thereby declares the inſufficiency of the man's own righteouſneſs being ſuch as the law cannot juſtifie him for; but the ſufficiency of the other righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for which he juſtifies him, this now will bring in Chriſt and his obedience into the new law, where our <hi>Neonomians</hi> will permit him to have nothing to do, but only as a Legiſlator, as for his Obedience and Satisfaction, it belonged to the old law only, with purchaſe of the new-remedying law. Laſtly, its Nonſence, that any law, or God in a law, ſhould impute Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for righteouſneſs which is not perfectly ſo, according to the law conſtitution, but he doth it upon the account of the Merits and Satisfaction of Chriſt: How upon the account? and is the Merits and Satisfaction of Chriſt put in the Ballance with our imperfect righteouſneſs to make it up? or is Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to it that it cannot be, unleſs imputed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? which he denies, how then muſt we underſtand this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? for the Satisfaction and Merits of Chriſt is only effective, becauſe Chriſt was ſo kind as to purchaſe Merit, and ſatisfie God for the new law, without which he could not have been juſtified by our imperfect righteouſneſs, and this is all they intend by it, for the Merits of Chriſt's ſake, a plain and facile ſimile may be given, A Man ows a great deal of Money to his Creditor that's ſuing of him in Court, a friend of the Debtor and Creditor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and brings the Creditor to a Compoſition of 10 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> or 1 <hi>s.</hi> in the pound; theſe Writings brought into the Court, the Action is diſmiſſed for the Merits, Purchaſe and procurement of this perſon, who now brought the Debtor under the new law of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41447:77"/>Compoſition, which if the Debtor do not pay he is ſuible upon his Compoſition: Now this is all theſe men make of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, its only his bringing God to the New Law Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Pardon and Life,</hi> he adds, <hi>as effects of Juſtification:</hi> We have already ſhewed what an abſurd thing Juſtification is without Pardon, Pardon being eſſential to it; but it ſeems to be as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, if not more, that there ſhould be Juſtification without life; for if by condemnation a man be dead in law, then certainly, by Juſtification, wherein Condemnation is taken off, the perſon is made alive in law. But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have a man to be juſtified, and both ly under the guilt and condemnation of ſin; for he adds to theſe which he calls Benefits. <hi>a right to impunity;</hi> ſo that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication lays but in the foundation of impunity, they are not from under punity, Juſtification brings only an expectation of Pardon, Life, Impunity hereafter, but none of theſe are in hand.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>When I ſay, this Righteouſneſs (or Faith) is the form, I underſtand it in the ſence as theſe Divines do, who ſay, Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is the form, or Remiſſion is the form, not the form of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but of Juſtification paſſively taken. Reſp.</hi> Then the plain meaning is that Mr. <hi>Humph.</hi> underſtands our righteouſneſs to have that place in cauſality of Juſtification, which others give to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; if other Divines ſay, that Chriſt's is the formal reaſon of Juſtification, in the ſenſe that they take Chriſt's righteouſneſs to be the formal cauſe in the perſon juſtified, he takes a man's own righteouſneſs to ſtand <hi>in genere cauſalitatis,</hi> this is Diametrical Oppoſition, and therefore not only to be ſcrupled, but to be contradicted and deteſted. Hum. <hi>Not the form of that Imputation, but of Juſtification paſſively taken. Reſp.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds his Notion by his obſcure Logick; for there is a great difference between the form of a thing, and <hi>formalis ratio agentis,</hi> the form is an eſſential cauſe, and enters the effect, the effect made up of the <hi>vis</hi> of all the cauſes hath exiſtence from concourſe of all the cauſes, the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> is <hi>cauſa movens efficientem, &amp; non ingreditur effectum,</hi> tho the form doth, which is another thing. Now Juſtification in the abſtract is <hi>forma juſtificationis in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto,</hi> or in the perſon juſtified, and there is not any other form, as <hi>Juſtitia</hi> is the form of <hi>juſtus,</hi> or of a man imputed juſt, that the imputation makes him legally juſt, to be juſt and imputed ſo is one thing in law, and to be juſtified is another. Now the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of a man is the form of the juſt man, and the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of Juſtification, and this he ſaith is the form of Juſtification paſſively taken; this we deny, and for Juſtification is active, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41447:77"/>the juſtified is the paſſive, where Juſtification it ſelf is the form. Again, we deny that our righteouſneſs is the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; Remiſſion indeed belongs to the form it ſelf, but the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of Juſtification is external to the form, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be conſidered apart from it. This only by the way</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>I add at laſt upon the account of Chriſts Merits, or through Chriſt, or for Chriſts ſake, becauſe this faith of ours or Evangelick Righteouſneſs, hath ſo many defects in the beſt Chriſtians, that if thro the ſacrifice of Chriſt they were not pardoned, and through his Merits thoſe imperfect duties which are done accepted, it could not be imputed to us for Righteouſneſs. Reſp.</hi> Chriſt is beholden to him to bring him at laſt, tho but at the fagg end of Juſtification: But how comes Juſtification to be at laſt upon the account of Chriſt, for we are formally juſtified upon the account of our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> perfectly ſo, for what is formally exiſtent is perfectly ſo, and that by our own righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the account of it, for the effect <hi>quod è cauſis exiſtit,</hi> is ſuch upon the account of all the cauſes, but eſpecially upon account of the form; now he that is formally thus juſtified, muſt be upon all accounts juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and needs nothing to be added to it: Why then upon the account of Chriſt's Merits? why, becauſe Chriſt purchaſed a law of righteouſneſs which could not juſtifie perfectly, but leaves the perſon juſtified in a need of further righteouſneſs for Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the Merits and Sacrifice of Chriſt muſt come in upon the account of which a man is juſtified, then he is not juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and Chriſt's righteouſneſs is the juſtifying righteouſneſs only; for our own leaves us unjuſtified by Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> it leaves us in ſuch a caſe that no man of ſenſe can ſay we are juſtified; for by his own words, the righteouſneſs of the new law is not, cannot be imputed to us for righteouſneſs, unleſs it be pardoned and accepted in Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore this law cannot juſtifie any one upon his inherent righteouſneſs, for its moſt abſurd to ſay, it can juſtifie, when it cannot impute its own righteouſneſs by reaſon of the defects thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 6. I find Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is at a great loſs in eſtabliſhing his Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a right bottom, he ſeems to ſuſpect that Chriſt may come off a loſer by it, and he will moſt fearfully. <hi>I do more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſignifie thereby that Chriſts righteouſneſs which cannot be imputed to us as a formal cauſe of our Juſtification is and muſt be very carefully brought to our account, and granted to be imputed, and the meritorious cauſe of our acceptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> I am glad to ſee this ſaying, wherein he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown his own Doctrine, tho uttered in a great contradiction; for he ſaith, Chriſt's cannot be imputed, and then it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41447:78"/>but why cannot it in the firſt place? That which is put to our account in Juſtification, whether as to the part or to the whole of our righteouſneſs is imputed, but according to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> the Merits of Chriſt's is put to our account, and therefore the Merits of Chriſt (to ſpeak more diſtinctly) thus put to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, are the <hi>materialis &amp; formalis ratio</hi> of our Juſtification; for if the merits of Chriſt be put to our account in Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its but trifling to ſay, its only the effects, if one man pay for another in part or whole, its the money it ſelf paid that is put to his account, and therefore imputed to him in Court; and indeed he ingeniouſly confeſſeth he learned of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to mend his Notion, and allowed Chriſt's Merit to be the material cauſe of our Juſtification; but that which he amends with one hand he ſpoils with another, and thereby runs into groſſer logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Abſurdities, ſaying, <hi>Becauſe I make our faith the formal in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Reſp.</hi> Very good, The matter is in one ſubject, in Chriſt, and the form in us another; <hi>Cauſa per qua res eſt id quod eſt</hi> is in us, <hi>ex qua</hi> in Chriſt in a legal act, Chriſt's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is but generical, matter which is as much for all the world as a Believer; but the formal part, the <hi>proprium &amp; diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi> is in the ſubject, Man; this in law is always the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious part; Money in general turns no Cauſe there, but its the Propriety that this or that man hath that doth it; now its not Chriſt's righteouſneſs in ſpecial that doth the buſineſs, but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in general that Chriſt hath brought in, as a material part, but its mans righteouſneſs in ſpecial that is the principal eſſential cauſe, according to Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>After this I diſtinguiſh between this pardoning, and bearing with the defects of our Faith, Repentance and new Obedience, which are the condition of the Goſpel Covenant, and ſo our Goſpel Righteouſneſs, or that which is Imputed for Righteouſneſs; and that General or Total Pardon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Reſp.</hi> If Juſtification be upon performing theſe as a law condition, what need all this talk about bearing with our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects? If the Goſpel Covenant run in theſe Terms, he that doth what he can ſhall live; therefore Man doing what he can, leaves no room for bearing with defects, he fulfils the Law in doing what he can. Again, if this be imputed to us for righteouſneſs by the law, and we diſcharged and declared righteous thereon, it is enough. Where alſo obſerve what imputation the <hi>Neonomians</hi> owns, its imputation of our own righteouſneſs to our ſelves: And ſuch a righteouſneſs as is none, becauſe imperfect and ſinful; but yet imputed for righteouſneſs to us, as if it were perfect; what's the reaſon then that its found defective after imputation, if imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by imputation comes in the room and doth as well as perfect?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41447:78"/>Nay, what's the reaſon that this righteouſneſs that is ſuch a paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey one, which can do nothing (by their own conceſſion) in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification without Chriſts, muſt have the honour of being imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us? but Chriſt muſt not, cannot be imputed, and why I pray? Becauſe tho' its acknowledged to be perfect and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt righteouſneſs, yet it may not be imputed to us for ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe performed by Chriſt and not by us. I pray let me ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not more comport with the honour of God, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Goſpel and common Reaſon, to impute legally to a delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the payment of another which is perfect full and compleat, then to impute to him the payment of his whole debt, for 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> or 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 4 <hi>d.</hi> Nay, after this acceptance how honourable would it be to the Court, to ſue to the King for the pardon of the Priſoner for paying ſo little.</p>
               <p>§. 8. But let us come to the other part of the diſtinction — <hi>And that general and total Pardon which the Covenant promiſes, and becomes Abſolute upon performing the Condition. Reſp.</hi> Either the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onomians</hi> have loſt their underſtandings, or think all other Men have, and ſo think they may impoſe what they pleaſe upon them; for here he diſtinguiſhes betwixt a conditional Goſpel Covenant, and a Goſpel Covenant upon conditions, a total Covenant and a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, a total upon conditions, and a partial abſolute upon perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of conditions, and all theſe one new law Covenant; a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that pardons upon conditions, and a Covenant abſolutely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning upon conditions. The total pardon, if that which pardons all the World upon conditions not performed, and yet it damns them too for non performances, a pardoning Covenant that damns all, for it remains not a pardon upon conditions when any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the conditions, its then abſolute; but did ever any one know that a conditional Covenant when the condition is performed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, <hi>i.e.</hi> without conditions? if any Man buy a Houſe of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a Summ of Money, will he ſay after he has paid his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, my Neighbour gave me this Houſe, for an abſolute promiſe is a promiſe of free Gift. He proceeds, <hi>The one of theſe is that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grace, or Act of Grace it ſelf, as goes into that Act of Imputation, or Act that imputes our Faith for Righteouſneſs when the other ſtill is the Effect or benefit following juſtification.</hi> Reſp. The Man is in a Wood: <hi>The one of theſe an act of Grace,</hi> which of them? That which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional pardon without performance, or that which upon perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance becomes abſolute, the total general, or the partial, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which I know not, but one it is; that is an Act of Grace going into the Act of Imputation: Imputation is an Act of Juſtice in ſtrict acceptation, becauſe its never but of righteouſneſs, tho' to bring righteouſneſs to a ſinner, to whom the Law imputes righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41447:79"/>is an act of Grace, as Juſtification is, but it muſt not be his own righteouſneſs, for that excludes Grace.</p>
               <p>§. 9. He is a little cautious of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. opinion, <hi>that Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the making us righteous,</hi> but he ſaith he will diſtinguiſh, <hi>there is a making a Man juſt by infuſion or by Imputation; that by infuſion, is Regeneration, which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>hold, and which we diſtinguiſh from Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſ.</hi> The righteouſneſs by which they'll have a man juſtified is that of Regeneration, and that of Works, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> way has more of Grace in it, becauſe theirs is Juſtification of the ungodly, as Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is Sanctifying the ungodly. Some he ſaith are for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by pardon, and ſo a Man is righteous by non-imputation of Sin, but he is not for this neither, becauſe he keeps pardon and non imputation of Sin for a conſequent of Juſtification; he will have a Man juſt in the Eye of the Law, and yet under the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Sin; well how will he have it to be? Its by imputation of what righteouſneſs? Chriſts? no, its by Imputation of our Faith to us for righteouſneſs.—<hi>Our Faith and Evangelical Obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imperfect and ſinful, and we are unrighteous in the Eye of the Law for all that, but God in his judging us according to the Law of Grace, doth allow of that, [i. e.</hi> Sin] <hi>for Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>ſake, inſtead of all which the Law requires to our Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Here you ſee what a parcel of righteouſneſs this New Law righteouſneſs is, its imperfect ſinful as to Sins of omiſſion and commiſſion and we are for all this righteous in the eye of the moral Law, but God judging by the Law of Grace, he allows all the Sin againſt his own Law for Chriſt's ſake, Chriſt hath merited Gods allowing our ſinful righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> Unrighteouſneſs and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us for it, but ſeeing here is all this done by the Law of Grace, how comes it to paſs that it doth not pardon theſe Sins, but they muſt go to another Bar for Pardon? Why, becauſe the Law of Grace, tho' it juſtifies the performer it pardons no Sin, becauſe no Law can ſuppoſe its own condition to be ſinful, but if there be Sin in the condition (as theſe Men ſay again and again there is) the Law of Grace allows it, (its certainly an <hi>Antinomian</hi> Law) allows that Sin that Gods moſt Holy Law condemns, God here muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf; and to ſay he allows it for Chriſts ſake, is to make Chriſt the Miniſter of Sin, die for allowance of Sin, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by Law, and if God by a new Law hath eſtabliſhed this ſinful Obedience inſtead of all which the old Law required, what need of asking pardon of the ſaid Law?

The ſence of the place is not difficult, it is that juſtifies a ſinner as ſuch, or elſe its no act of Free Grace, that when the Grace of Juſtification toucheth on the perſon of a ſinner, he is no more godly than when the Grace of Regeneration toucheth upon him; tho the Grace of God lays hold on a ſinner in both theſe reſpects, finding them ungodly in all reſpects, yet it leaves them not ſo: His enſuing Suppoſition is very impertinent, ſuppoſing that which never was nor never will be, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Believer living regenerate can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be juſtified by the law of works, by his own righteouſneſs; No, he can be juſtified by no law, neither did God ever make any law to account any mans unrighteouſneſs, righteouſneſs: I can call that unrighteouſneſs which the law of Works condemns, and God never intended by his Grace, nor Chriſt never died to purchaſe ſuch a <hi>Juſtification;</hi> far be it.</p>

We will let him alone to chide the <hi>Papiſts</hi> about infuſion of righteouſneſs, and let him clear himſelf from being a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in the Point of <hi>Juſtification</hi> if he can; let us ſee how he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits himſelf, <hi>The</hi> Papiſts <hi>Opinion is, that the Grace of God infuſed is the formal righteouſneſs that juſtifies us according to the law of works; they of</hi> Trent <hi>thought of no other; but our imperfect Faith and new Obedience is a conformity to that which God hath made a condition of life by the law of Grace, and is our formal righteouſneſs according to that law, being made ſo by God when he imputes it to us for righteouſneſs. By the Evangelical Law this is our righteouſneſs; we are made righteous,</hi> i. e. <hi>not guilty of the non-performance of the condition, according to Mr.</hi> B.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> According to his own Quotation the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold as <hi>Mr. B.</hi> and he, <hi>that habitual righteouſneſs is infuſed by God, ſo far as that a man endued therewith may be accounted truly righteous;</hi> they do ſuggeſt that they do not intend a perfect righteouſneſs, but ſo much as may admit at leaſt of an acceptillation, which <hi>Mr. H.</hi> gives us to underſtand the <hi>Neonomians</hi> approve of, and <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> and others tell us the Notion of a New Law was long ago among the <hi>Papists,</hi> and there's no doubt now our <hi>Neonomians</hi> have ſo briskly Trumpt up that old muſty piece of <hi>Popery,</hi> they will willingly fall in Hand-and-Glove with them, and rectifie their flaws according to the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Edition, they will call their works Evangelical, and calculate them to the height of the new Law, and carry all their merits thither, ſeeing there's in all probability the faireſt Market, and they bear the beſt Price there, their unrighteouſneſs will be called righteouſneſs, and his ſins will be allowed, there is no need of ſo many Indulgences, for one new-law-allowance will paſs for all. Again, do not the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſpeak of the ſame Works, Faith, Repentance, New Obedience? and what if they ſay they are the meaſure of conformity to the Law of Works? do they ſay they are juſtified by them abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered? do they not ſay for the ſake of <hi>Chriſt's Merits?</hi> why may not they be as well juſtified by the old-law-works for the merits of Chriſt's righteouſneſs as our <hi>Neonomians,</hi> by a new-law-righteouſneſs through the merits of Chriſt's righteouſneſs; for of the two, I had a thouſand times rather truſt to Juſtification by an old
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41447:80"/>law righteouſneſs through the merits of Chriſt, than to a new-law-righteouſneſs through our own merits; for <hi>Paul</hi> we know, and the old law we know, but as for the new law and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs thereof, we ſay, who are ye? and what is the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal? in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it is a plain contradiction to the law of works; when that chargeth all the world as guilty before God, this new law ſaith ſin maketh them not guilty, but is their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and the Evangelical Law finds them not guilty of non performance of the condition. The <hi>Moral</hi> law ſaith, if a man kills another he is guilty of non-performance of the condition, but the <hi>Evangelical</hi> ſaith, tho he kills a man, if he repent, and give ſome Alms, his killing a man makes his other obedience but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is the true nature of the condition, and therefore he is not guilty of the non-performance of the condition.</p>
               <p>§. 12. There's a myſtery here which he ſaith Dr. <hi>O.</hi> nor <hi>Mr. B.</hi> never gave its due conſideration, for Dr. <hi>O.</hi> ſaith, <hi>There's an imputation of a thing to us that is ours, and that is judging it ours, and dealing with us accordingly, or of a thing that is not ours, and that is by donation, and dealing with us according to it made ours, our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs cannot, but Chriſts righteouſneſs muſt be imputed to our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> To which he thus anſwers, <hi>As there is an imputing to a man a thing that is his, and a thing not his, ſo there is an imputing to a perſon that which is partly his, and partly not his, but that which in the effect becomes his by imputation, this never ſunk into the Dr's mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Sure the Doctor was a very ſhallow man, that he could think of the imputation of a thing that is ours, and of a thing not ours, and could not think of a thing partly ours, and partly not ours, but the reaſon of his not mentioning of it was becauſe he did not think any man of conſiſtent Brains, would propoſe ſuch a Juſtification. <hi>For</hi> ſaith <hi>Mr. H. there are two things in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, our Faith and God's Imputation —Faith, Repentance and new Obedience is one thing, and having it accepted is another.</hi> Now here lies the myſtery, its the making one thing two, our new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is ours, and ſanctification, but God's Imputation makes it ours for Juſtification, but its being ours, doth not God eſteem and judge it ours? how comes it now ours? if God eſteem it our righteouſneſs, how is it leſs ours than before? unleſs it be in this manner, a man hath a Cloth Coat on, this is his, another calls it a Silk Coat, this is not his becauſe he had no Silk Coat, but his Cloth Coat is made a Silk Coat by another in imputing it Silk; but he tells us, <hi>God's imputation brings nothing with it (in the effect, I ſay) that which was not ours, i. e. the Satisfaction and Merits of Chriſt.</hi> Doth the imputation of ours, at the ſame time
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41447:81"/>impute the Satisfaction and Merits of Chriſt? if ſo, then it doth bring ſomething not ours, and then we are juftified by two righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes, by ours and not ours; or will he have this a ſingle imputation, and both theſe made one, by mixture partly ours and partly Chriſts? for this anſwers his Notion beſt, partly his, and partly not his; but he excludes Chriſt's merits from impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation again and again. <hi>ergo</hi> the imputation is only of that which is ours, and his Diſtinction is a Chimaera, and if Dr. <hi>O.</hi> did not trouble his head with ſuch Whims his Conſideration is not to be blamed. But he tells us, <hi>that which is not ours comes after impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as an effect, the Satisfaction and Merits of Chriſt;</hi> but they become not ours by imputation, therefore one leg of his diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution is dropt off, for he ſaith, <hi>there's an imputation of a thing ours, and a thing not ours;</hi> this thing <hi>not ours,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſt's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> he ſaith is not imputed, but comes in <hi>as an effect of this imputation of our own righteouſneſs;</hi> but why muſt Chriſt's Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction come in the rear? becauſe a man muſt be juſtified firſt, and then Chriſt's Satisfaction muſt come in to mend the faults of his Juſtification, as a remedying righteouſneſs, the formal part of his Juſtification muſt be pardoned and accepted, and before his Juſtification hath releaſed the man from condemnation and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptableneſs to God, he muſt have <hi>the effect</hi> of his Juſtification; hence this imputation of ours is the cauſe of our pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation by Chriſt's Merits, an imputation of our immoral righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs the cauſe of a perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But how can we have pardon through the Satisfaction of Chriſt, and acceptance through his merits, without God's imputation of them to us? for if by the rules of Juſtice in the New Law Court our righteouſneſs is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, how comes it to paſs that when we come ſinners into the old law Court, we can there become righteous, free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and accepted by Satisfaction and Merit, and yet not have it imputed to us? this is moſt extra-judicial, for a Court al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imputes that ſatisfaction and merit to the perſon diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is paid into Court for it: It were eaſie to run endleſly upon ſhewing the groſs abſurdities of this Divinity; for they will have the New Law to impute righteouſneſs which they ſay is no righteouſneſs, and the Old Laws righteouſneſs to be good and perfect, but not imputed; ſo that indeed, according to their Doctrine, the ſinner is ruin'd for want of righteouſneſs: Under the New Law is no righteouſneſs, and under the Old Law good righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs but no imputation, without which a ſinner can never be juſtified; now if they would permit theſe two laws to meet and agree the matter, ſomething might be done, then the New Law might borrow the Old Laws righteouſneſs, and the Old, the New Laws Imputation.</p>

               <p>Sect. 1. MR. <hi>H.</hi> for the better eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Doctrine hath taken up a diſtinction from his friend Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine. The</hi> Proteſtants (ſaith Mr. <hi>H.) have denied that Faith is our formal Righteouſneſs;</hi> (Righ. p. 46.) <hi>the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the denial hath bin much, becauſe they have confounded the</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa per quam, &amp; propter quam, <hi>by Faith ſaith the Scripture we are juſtified, by is</hi> id per quod cauſa formalis, <hi>but Chriſts Righteouſneſs is</hi> id propter quod: Let us ſee out of whoſe Shop he took this Diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inction, <hi>Bellarmine (de juſt. lib.</hi> 2. c. 2.) having ſtated the Queſtion. <hi>Whether Righteouſneſs inherent in us, be the formal cauſe of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Juſtification or not?</hi> In order to his defence of it in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, hath this diſtinction, and chargeth <hi>Kemnitius</hi> with fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dealing in ſtating the Queſtion, becauſe he put <hi>id propter quod,</hi> inſtead of <hi>per quam,</hi> ſaith: <hi>If one will ſpeak properly, he muſt not uſe the Word</hi> propter, <hi>but</hi> per, <hi>when he will point out the formal cauſe of Juſtification. If any one ask by what doth a Man live? By what do the Stars ſhine? By what is the Fire hot? It will be anſwer'd by his Soul, by the Light, by the Heat, which are the formal cauſes; but if any ask wherefore did the Emperour Triumph, wherefore did the Souldiers fight. It will be anſwered not by giving the formal cauſe, but the meritorious and final, the Souldiers fight that they may overcome, the Emperour triumphs becauſe he overcame; ſo</hi> Kemnitius <hi>if he had ſpoken without fraud and properly ſhould have ſaid, what is that by which a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41447:82"/>Man is Juſtified; whether the Righteouſneſs given to him of God, and inherent through the Merits of Chriſt, or the Merits of Chriſt from without him imputed?</hi> Now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> having ſo fully acquainted us with the diſtinction, according to the full ſenſe of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I think it will be but loſs of Paper and Time to tranſcribe what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith of it, again and again, being but all to the ſame intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>§. 2. This diſtinction duly conſidered is but one of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhifts and Evaſions, for <hi>Firſt,</hi> In all juridical proceedings <hi>cauſa per quam eſt cauſa propter quam,</hi> for a Mans righteouſneſs is that by which and for which he is juſtified, and ſo his tranſgreſſion is that by which and reaſon wherefore he is condemned, and if meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous righteouſneſs of a Mans own or of anothers is brought into Plea and be admitted, he is ſaid to be juſtified by it, if it be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how came ſuch an one to be acquitted, the Anſwer will be by his Innocency; how came ſuch an one to be condemned, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will as ſoon be by, as for Wickedneſs, all Righteouſneſs by which any one is Juſtified is <hi>propter quam,</hi> its that by Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is Juſtified, why doth the New Law juſtifie him that hath performed the condition, is his Righteouſneſs the Juſtifying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is not the Juſtification <hi>propter conditionem,</hi> if it doth refuſe to Juſtifie, becauſe the condition is not performed, then it juſtifies not, becauſe it is not performed; in all conditional Covenants the promiſe is performed, by reaſon of the performance of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2.

               <p>§. 3. <hi>The</hi> Papiſts <hi>by this diſtinction would make way for a double righteouſneſs in our Juſtification; for the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>doth anathematize thoſe that ſay, a man is juſtified only by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or only by remisſion of ſins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inherent Grace and Charity.</hi> To this purpoſe our <hi>Neonomian</hi> Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> p. 35. <hi>That the merit of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings</hi> [he excluding his active obedience] <hi>hath purchaſed this priviledge for us among others, that ſincere faith ſhould be accounted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that God will account us righteous if we be poſſest thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> In both theſe we ſee Chriſt's righteouſneſs is made the <hi>propter quam,</hi> and our own the <hi>per quam,</hi> Chriſt's the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of our Juſtification by our own righteouſneſs, whereby the aſcribing any eſſential cauſality to Chriſt's righteouſneſs is out of doors: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Juſtification by our own (') is entire in all eſſential cauſes without Chriſt's; for our righteouſneſs imputed muſt be the material as well as the formal part of our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be firſt imputed and we juſtified by it, for they make not only the Condition but the Imputation thereof, and Juſtification thereby (') to be conditional of our pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The very righteouſneſs of our own is imputed, not Chriſts Righteouſneſs at all, only the effects; cauſe and effects are <hi>oppoſita,</hi> therefore if the effects only, then not the righteouſneſs it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To ſay that Chriſt purchaſed Juſtification by our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is but to make Chriſt ſuch a remote cauſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as Election is. Now to talk that the condition by which we are juſtified is a formal cauſe, and yet to be no cauſe, is non-ſence, for a formal cauſe, altho it be <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> and ſo is every cauſe, yet the four immediate cauſes are not only ſo, and this diſtinguiſheth them as <hi>propter</hi> immediate cauſes, whoſe <hi>vis</hi> caters the effect, when <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> as to the effect, is only antecedent, or <hi>cauſa cauſae,</hi> and enters not the effect ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith, <hi>its a cauſe as well as a condition, it is both, if we made our works to juſtifie us</hi> ſub genere cauſae efficientis, procatarct <hi>and ſo the meritorious cauſe, it were to bring our works into the office of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and derogate from Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> So they do notwithſtanding all they ſay, for if they thruſt out Chriſt's Righteouſneſs from any eſſential part of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as they do, not allowing it materiality or formality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they put our own Works into Chriſt's Office; and nothing can be more derogatory to the Grace of God; they ſay, they make it <hi>medus efficientis, cauſa procatarchtica,</hi> an external motive to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41447:83"/>efficient; the effect then in that reſpect falls on the efficient, but the effect of the efficient is another thing: Suppoſing God juſtifies as Judge, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs by way of Merit falls upon him, and procures of him that he takes our righteouſneſs in payment. We may uſe this Similitude, a Man is proſecuted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Judge for an hundred Pounds, a Friend of the Defendant tampers with the Jury and Judge, and procures of them that the Debtor pay but 10 <hi>l.</hi> I pray, whether is he juſtified by paying the 10 <hi>l.</hi> in Court, or by that which the Judge and Jury received, which is not brought in Plea at all? ſo that all meritorious righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is brought in Plea <hi>coram Judice,</hi> and accordingly being imputed or not, Judgment paſſeth. The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whatever it may purchaſe out of the Court of the New Law, its not allowed there as a Plea, and is never, nay cannot be imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (theſe men ſay) though pleaded, therefore no Juſtification thereby, for no man is juſtified legally, but by what is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>But when we make it the formal cauſe only (of our paſſive Juſtification) we do nothing thereby but advance God's Grace and Chriſt's Merits, as having obtained for us, not only that God ſhould require of us no oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Note, 1. They do ſomething beſides advancing the Grace of God, becauſe it makes Juſtification due to us upon Debt, for he that hath a formal right-ouſneſs of his own legally imputed to him, he may demand Juſtification as due to him by the law it ſelf, and this is not to advance Grace, but contrary, if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeak ſence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not an advance of Chriſt's Merits, for it caſts it out of Imputation and Juſtification, and makes it but a <hi>cauſa ſine quanon,</hi> it caſts them out of the eſſential cauſes, and it makes them but an adjuvant cauſe, or con-cauſe, a co-ordinate (according to Mr. <hi>H.</hi>) it makes not Chriſt's Merits the only righteouſneſs; it makes our own righteouſneſs the inchoate and foundation righteouſneſs, the Corner Stone of our Juſtification; and whereas the Scriptures make Chriſt's, it makes Chriſt's Righteouſneſs but to belong to another law, whereby they ſay we are not juſtified and our own to that which juſtifies, and the only juſtifying righteouſneſs of the new law; it makes Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and our Pardon by it, to be a conſequent of Juſtification by our own, and that without imputation thereof extra-judicial, but our own very righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be imputed to us; it makes that righteouſneſs within its
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41447:83"/>ſelf and own nature, (ſaith Mr. <hi>H.</hi> again and again) to be righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs legal for our Juſtification, and rejects Chriſt's perfect Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs as to Imputation and Juſtification, which is contrary to the Holineſs and Juſtice of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He makes the Grace of God to conſiſt in conſtituting a Law for Juſtification, which is but part of diſtributive Juſtice, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of a Legiſlative Power, and not of Grace to Sinners.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The conſtitution of this inchoste righteouſneſs is harder terms than the conſtitution of the righteouſneſs of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, for Reaſons before given.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ſee what their meaning is of Chriſt's Merits, its only that he purchaſed a new Law, and we ſee what is the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Commutation that they have of late made ſuch a ſtir about, they are for a Commutation; what's that? its a commutation of our righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> bringing into the room of the righteouſneſs of the law (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt's) in Juſtification, they deny it in Dr. <hi>C</hi>'s ſence, <hi>i. e.</hi> that our ſins were imputed to Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs to us; for they expreſly deny both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Mr. <hi>H. So as</hi> Adam, <hi>if he had perfectly obeyed, his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had been his formal righteouſneſs in regard of the law.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41447:84"/>and merits Juſtification, and the remuneration thereof as much as <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſtanding and performing the condition of the Law of Works, had merited Juſtification thereby. Likewiſe, as to Perfection they are right, for that is a man's Perfection which the Law makes ſo, and juſtifies a man by, the Law matters not what other laws make perfect performance; the Old Law is no rule to the New Law, that's a man's Perfection which the Law that juſtifies him ſaith is the performance of the condition. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> quotes Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for ſaying, the New Law acquits a man from non-performance of the condition; and what need ſuch an one pray for Pardon any more than they that ſay, they are juſtified in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs (the great Cry they make againſt Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, what need ſuch an one pray for Pardon?) for if their Juſtification in and by their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, be not as perfect diſcharging from guilt by Pardon, as ours is in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, its not worth a Fig, we deſire no ſuch trifling Juſtifications.</p>

There are two great Points to be cleared in this Controverſie:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Scripture excludes all inherent righteouſneſs from the Juſtification of a Sinner before God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt be imputed to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for his Juſtification before God? Theſe Queſtions ſhall be maintained by us in the Affirmative, God willing, in their due place.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Whereas Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Prides himſelf exceedingly in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41447:84"/>ſingularity of his Notion of our Righteouſneſs being the formal cauſe of our Juſtification, any one may ſee it in Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and <hi>J. Goodwyn,</hi> from both whom its eaſie to ſhew how the <hi>Neonomians</hi> have taken up their Doctrine; as for the Notion it ſelf it labours under many weakneſſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Righteouſneſs in it ſelf is not the formal but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial reaſon of Juſtification, that which induceth the form is a legal Imputation; for if a man be never ſo innocent and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if the Court do not impute him ſo, he ſhall not be juſtified, and if a man be never ſo unrighteous, if the Court impute righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to him, he ſhall be juſtified; ſo its here, Imputation is the legal form of Juſtification, and righteouſneſs is but the material only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He makes a formal reaſon without material; for if our own righteouſneſs be the formal reaſon where's the material? he will not make Chriſt's Merits the material; for he brings in them <hi>ſub genere cauſae efficientis,</hi> beſides he cannot, for it would be very abſurd to place the matter in one ſubject, and the form in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore his formal reaſon is immaterial, and its indeed but an imagenary Chymaera, both his New Law and his Formal Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Righteouſneſs if it be the formal reaſon of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, its ſuch as <hi>per quam homo juſtus eſt,</hi> and that is in law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>propter quod,</hi> for no law juſtifies any one; but becauſe he is righteous, his righteouſneſs muſt conſtitute him juſt, and the law eſteeming him ſo, he is juſtified as legally meritorious thereof: the noiſe Mr. <hi>B. J. G.</hi> and others make of the diſtinction between conſtitutive and declarative Juſtification, is <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it; conſtitutive Juſtification is no more than Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is that which in law conſtitutes any one juſt and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of declarative Juſtification.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes a diſtinction of Juſtification, that its active and paſſive, whereas Juſtification is but one, and it doth not conſtitute properly a phyſical effect, but a legal relation, it doth neither find nor make any ſinner inherently righteous (for Juſtification of a righteous perſon finds him inherently ſo, this Juſtification we ſpeak not of) but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have a paſſive Juſtification upon this account, becauſe it finds the ſinner righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inherently; he ſaith indeed, <hi>the infuſion of this preceeding righteouſneſs is not his Juſtification, according to the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>but his Juſtification is for the righteouſneſs which it finds infuſed, and ſo its the formal cauſe of Juſtification:</hi> He might with much better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſay, that Sanctification is double, active ſanctifying, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſanctified; but where there is the cauſe working, there is the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41447:85"/>effect wrought, and the juſtified is but the effect, and conſtitutes no diſtinct ſpecies of it. But we ſay, the Grace of Juſtification of a Sinner, proceeding from Grace, is wholly in and from God, and hath no cauſe in a Sinner material or formal, nor is there any cauſe external of that Grace, the moving cauſe only is the good will and pleaſure of God; <hi>he is gracious to whom he will;</hi> graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pardoning Iniquity is only from his Grace and for the glory of his Grace, which cannot be in the Juſtification of a righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe, not ſimply Grace, but alſo Juſtice ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in a ſinner's juſtification, and God in his pardon, will not clear the guilty, he hath graciouſly provided and beſtowed on the ſinner a righteouſneſs accepted by the Law, and imputed to him, that he may appear therein juſt, and ſo juſt in adminiſtration of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as not to infringe his Juſtice in the leaſt, but to the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Law ſtanding in its full force againſt the ſinner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Relaxation. This is done quite contrary to the <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> Doctrine; therefore Gods Juſtification falling upon a Sinner, makes actually a correlate to Gods juſtifying, and faith is no more than the Sinners reception of this Grace; no part of that righteouſneſs by which faith or for which the Sinner is juſtified, neither is it a grain of that righteouſneſs which is imputed to him.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> alſo hath another diſtinction between <hi>condition and duty,</hi> which I will not ſtay upon becauſe its frivolous and it is becauſe he will have the duties of the Law to be performed by us, tho we be not juſtified by them, he inſiſts upon a Relaxation of the old Law but not a total Abolition, Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> Opinion is that its abrogated as much as the Ceremonial Law, wherein both penalty and duty is taken away, and indeed Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is in the right according to his notion, for the introduction of a New Law in the room of it and for the ends that the old Law was eſtabliſht is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the nulling of the ſaid old Law, but how then can Mr. <hi>B.</hi> be ſecured from a juſt charge of <hi>Antinomian viz.</hi> that moral duties are not required of us, which is more <hi>Antinomian</hi> than I ever ſaw in any he chargeth with it, he hath one poor ſhift, which is that the duties of the old-Law are taken or ſpunged up in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the New; but however the broken pieces are pickt up, the Law it ſelf is gone, and there's no tranſgreſſion upon that account, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith the Law's only relaxed but his relaxation is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Crack in the middle of a Glaſs and heart of it; and he hath not told us how far this relaxation goes, and every man will be ready to plead for his own ſin that the Law in that reſpect is relaxt. But he would have us believe, that the moral duties ſtill remain, how relaxt or not? If relaxt then at leaſt to an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, a man may do them or not without any ſin; but he ſaith they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41447:85"/>are re-eſtabliſhed in the New-Law, if ſo they are re-eſtabliſhed without the Relaxation and then the New-Law is as ſtrict as the Old, or with the relaxation, and then all duties are required with abatement as to quality and quantity, with an allowance of ſin, our <hi>poſſe</hi> or <hi>velle,</hi> and what is more <hi>Antinomianiſm? But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Conditions are not Duties,</hi> It was never affirmed by men of reaſon, that the Condition of a Law is not a Duty; for that which is required of us upon pain of puniſhment is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Duty, and to the Condition of the New-Law the higheſt, becauſe it hath the Sanction of a Law of the Higheſt, he that continueth not in all things by way of performance that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth is curſed by it, if it be but imperfect obedience; it ſaith, he that continueth not in imperfect obedience is curſed by it, therefore when the Saints come to Heaven, and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfect obedience they fall under the Curſe of the new law, or elſe its out of doors before they come there, or the laſt day, and the World can't be judged by it. Laſtly, What are the conditions of imperfect obedience? are they not Duties of Righteouſneſs by the performance whereof Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have us juſtified? Yes, this cannot be denied, but the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will hold with a <hi>quatenus,</hi> as they refer to the abſolute, relaxed Laws they are Duties, <hi>i. e.</hi> as they reſpect no Law, or a lawleſs Law; and as they refer to the New Law they are Conditions and are not Duties. Hence its no Duty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Conditions of the New Law for Juſtification thereby, and this is the Truth which we ſtand by, though infer'd truly from Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Logick and Divinity.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>Sect. 1. NOw it is time to come to Examine the grounds of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s Doctrine, in this Point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall treat of them that are the reaſoning Arguments, Artificial as called in Logick, the weakeſt in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and then thoſe that are pretended from Scripture, which in Logick are called inartificial, but if grounded upon Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the beſt and ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Againſt the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues thus. <hi>How can God account our Sins to be Chriſts and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ours when really they are not ſo, and Gods Judgment is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> this is uſed again and again by Mr. <hi>B,</hi> to which I ſhall Anſwer, 1. By retorting the Medium and not ſo tedious to put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any other form, how can God account our own New Law righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to be juſtifying righteouſneſs, when in its own nature its no righteouſneſs (Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith ſo over and over) and Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is according to Truth, now ſee the honeſty of theſe Men, God muſt not make a Judgment according to Truth in imputing Chriſts perfect righteouſneſs to us, becauſe it was not perſonally performed by us, and imputing our Sins to Chriſt, becauſe they were not actually committed by him, and yet God makes a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41447:86"/>according to Truth, in imputing our own paultry ſinful righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to us for our righteouſneſs, when they themſelves ſay its really no righteouſneſs. 2. Is not his righteouſneſs ours? The Scripture ſaith it is, and our Sins made his; they ſay it doth not, that we will try, God willing, but for the preſent we ask what if God give us this Righteouſneſs? What is freer than Gift? and what makes a better propriety than Free Gift? Is not Gods Judgment according to Truth, when he imputes that to us which he hath given? <hi>Its the Gift of Righteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>E. gr.</hi> A poor debtor is ſued in Court for an 100 l. and upon Trial he is found inſolvent, and Verdict is going to be given againſt him, the Judge throws him a Bag of 100 l. in Court and bids him pay the debt, ſhall not the Court impute this to him a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Payment, and give him a diſcharge, and is not the Judgment according to Truth? on the other hand another hath the like Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but is found inſolvent, the Judge or ſome other gives him a Bag of Counters, and bids him to pay his Creditor, he refuſeth the Money, ſaith its Braſs; well ſaith the Judge we will impute it to him for a lawful tender and good Payment, we will make that which is no righteouſneſs by our imputation to be a legal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo the Creditor may take the Bags of Counters and go ſhake his Ears, we call it good Money; now I appeal to theſe Men whether this be a Judgment according to Truth? And let them weigh it well and make application thereof, and if they can't make a rational reply, let them lay their Hands on their Mouth, and hold their peace for ever hereafter.</p>
               <p>§. 3. A ſecond great Argument taken from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is, <hi>That if it be ſo that Chriſts righteouſneſs is imputed to us for Juſtification, then ſhould the Elect be immediately freed from puniſhment, and immediately juſtified before they believed and repented, for no Terms could be Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on them in order to their Juſtification and Glory, if they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted already to have fulfilled the Law of Chriſt.</hi> And this is one <hi>(as he ſaith)</hi> of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> conſequences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Let it be ſo, we ſay then <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it be an <hi>Antinomian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, what is the reaſon Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> are ſuch <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> to ſay all the World are pardoned before Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yea, whether they believe or no? Why doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> aſſert two Juſtifications before Faith? 2. We reckon it no <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> to ſay, that Election perfectly freed the Elect from coming under the execution of the Vindictive Wrath of God and Curſe of the Law: Why elſe ſhould the Scripture ſay, <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> and whereas it may be ſaid before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Law will charge, for they are under the Law, its replied, <hi>its Chriſt that died, yea rather is riſen,</hi> having fully ſatisfied the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41447:87"/>Law of God, that they ſhall not fall under the Execution of the Curſe of it, and they are ſecured before God both by Election and Redemption, or elſe Chriſt died and roſe again in vain; and as they have this ſecurity, ſo they have an immediate right in Chriſt to the Life of Grace and Glory; They want the application and the receiving of this righteouſneſs, and a poſſeſſion thereof, which reception is by Faith that is not their own, but purchaſed and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by Chriſt; which was never purchaſed and given for their righteouſneſs, but as an Organ of Spiritual Life, whereby a Man created in Chriſt Jeſus may be ſenſible, and have the comfort of what is freely given to him of God; for by Faith a Man takes up the Peace which Chriſt hath made, and hath acceſs into the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace of God wherein he ſtands, and therefore comes from under the Law in his own Conſcience, and rejoiceth in the hope of the glory of God. 3. As for impoſing of Terms, its Idle, to think that Chriſt ſhould do what he did for Sinners in his Prieſtly Office, their Juſtification, and Salvation, and then to impoſe an impoſſibility upon them, without the performance of which all that he hath done ſhould be nothing to them; and do Men talk Sence when they talk of impoſing Terms upon Sinners for Eternal Life, the Terms ſhould be put upon them to be performed before they have Spiritual Life in their meer natural Eſtate, and then to make their notion to ſtand on its right bottom; they muſt be <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> its Eternal Life that is begun in Juſtification applied to the Believer and his Perſon by the Spirit, and its received Vitally and Senſibly by Faith, when the Sinner is made a live by the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying work of the Spirit, his Life of Faith is part of the Eternal Life purchaſed: Can any Terms of Life be impoſed on a dead Man, what Terms were impoſed upon <hi>Lazarus;</hi> if the roling away the Grave-Stone was the Term, it was not impoſed on him, it was on them that ſtood about the Grave, if they ſay God will give theſe Terms, as they muſt ſay to ſave themſelves from <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> then the Term lies upon God, and its Idle to ſay they are impoſed upon incapable Subjects, neither is that Impoſed upon me as a Term that cannot be expected from me, unleſs by the donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, by any rational Man. 4. The clauſe follows not according to Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Principles, who ſaith Chriſt ſatisfied the Law (tho I know what the <hi>Neonomians</hi> talk of, they intend no true ſatisfaction) did Chriſt ſatisfie the Law in what Sence they will? Was it for himſelf or for us? if for himſelf, then he offended it, this they will not ſay, then for us; if for us, our Offence was taken of before God, thereby God was in him by reaſon of his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not imputing our Treſpaſſes; how can it be otherwiſe but we muſt be accounted by God to have fulfilled the Law in Chriſt, if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41447:87"/>Gods judgment be according to Truth, and why may not this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be, and our fulfilling in Chriſt be before we had a being in the World? this was actually performed for the Saints before his coming, long after moſt of them were dead, why not for thoſe that are to come before they have life? and why may they not be called to a fellowſhip with Chriſt, and participation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt in Satisfaction by Faith? when the day of their Regeneration comes. This is the dangerous Doctrine that theſe poor blind men are ſo afraid of.</p>
               <p>§. 4. There is another Argument of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. which he takes to be <hi>Herculean,</hi> and admires, and it looks as if it were out of his own Forge and he chargeth Mr. <hi>L.</hi> to hearken to it. <hi>Animadv. p.</hi> 67. <hi>There is nothing can be imputed to us, but either that which we have not, and then it is that we may have it, that is, to have it made ours, or reputed as ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> There is nothing can be imputed to a Sinner for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs but that which he hath not firſt, but is given (ſo ſaith Mr. <hi>H.</hi>) and here's the difference, he ſaith, inherent Grace is given for righteouſneſs, we ſay, the obedience of Chriſt is given for our righteouſneſs, which the Scripture ſaith; now it is given that it may be imputed ours legally, and its imputed that we may be juſtified; it is not imputed that we may have it, but becauſe we have it it is imputed; Mr. <hi>H.</hi> herein goes againſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or elſe if we have it, it muſt be imputed to ſome other end than to have it. Anſw.</hi> Yes, its imputed legally that we may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we have it by gift, <hi>prius natura,</hi> by gift of Grace, for we muſt have the righteouſneſs before the Law can judge we have it, becauſe legal Judgment is according to Truth. Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification runs thus far, that we muſt have a righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is imputed, nay, and he ſaith its by Gift too. <hi>Now if Chriſt did obey or ſuffer in our perſons, or as our legal perſon, ſo as in law ſence we have, and are accounted to have obeyed and ſuffered in him, then can his righteouſneſs (conſiſting of his Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings) be neither imputed to us that we may have it, or be made ours, or reckoned to us as ours, ſeeing we have it already; it is ours, it is reckoned as ours, in that it was performed in our perſons; nor can it be imputed to us to any other end, or thing, but</hi> ad juſtitiam, <hi>which is to the ſame end, and for the ſame thing, and can be no other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thinks this Argument irrefrigable, and that it will carry all before it, but poor men (as moſt oppoſers of truth) have the unhappineſs to ſmite with the backs of their Swords, and cut themſelves with the edge. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> argues, if we have Chriſt's righteouſneſs, we cannot have it by Imputation.</p>
               <p>We do not ſay we have it by imputation any other than a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41447:88"/>allowance that we have it, having it is antecedent to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal allowance, it is not ſo in their Principles? <hi>we have our own righteouſneſs before it is imputed to us.</hi> But if in a law-ſence we are accounted to have obeyed and ſuffered in Chriſt, then his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs cannot be imputed unto us, <hi>cujus contrarium verum,</hi> yea, therefore its imputed unto us, for one man's payment is not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and imputed to another, unleſs the payment be made in his perſon in a law-ſence; it is ours, and reckoned as ours in that it was performed in our perſons, he ſaith, therefore as ſuch it is reckoned and imputed to us, nor can it be imputed to us for any other end than <hi>for righteouſneſs,</hi> we ſay and you ſay.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Arguments for Faith and Obedience being the Formal Cauſe of our Juſtification, we ſhall examine in the next place, they are, as Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> hath gathered them up, <hi>By the conſent of all Divines, That righteouſneſs which denominates us righteous in the ſight of God, muſt be the form or formal part of our Juſtification; But neither Regeneration, nor Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, nor Pardon is that which juſtifies per modum cauſae formalis, and therefore it muſt be Faith. Reſp.</hi> 1. He ſhould have added <hi>imputed,</hi> to the things enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the <hi>minor;</hi> for he ſaith to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> he means ſo. 2. If he doth mean ſo, he putteth the material and formal cauſe together, and therefore I ſhall deny his Minor under the term of eſſential cauſes, which takes in his formal: As to the <hi>major</hi> I except, that all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do not hold that righteouſneſs that denominates us righteous before God is the formal cauſe, but inſiſt on the <hi>minors</hi> denial, that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt doth not denominate us righteous before God, for ſo ſhould the <hi>aſſumption</hi> be; the <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> as it ſtands is falſe, having one medium in <hi>Major,</hi> another in the <hi>Minor.</hi> Dare Mr. <hi>H.</hi> be ſo ſcandalous as to ſpeak out his <hi>Minor</hi> as he ought by his <hi>Medium,</hi> That Chriſt's Righteouſneſs doth not denominate us righteous in the ſight of God, its plain that he ſhifts it off by a wrong Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and according to that fault makes his Proof. And I only ſay, that there's no righteouſneſs can denominate us righteous in the ſight of God, but what is fully ſatisfactory to the Law that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us; but there's no righteouſneſs fully ſatisfactory to the Law that condemns us, but Chriſt's. let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhew any other if he can; and as for the righteouſneſs of the New Law which he pleads for, he acknowledgeth that its no righteouſneſs in its own nature, that it needs Pardon at the Bar of the Old Law, and therefore it cannot denominate us righteous in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>§. 6. He proceeds to prove his falſe Aſſumption by parts. 1. That Chriſt's righteouſneſs is not that righteouſneſs whereby we are denominated righteous in the ſight of God: why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41447:88"/>ſaith he, it is the meritorious caſe: I anſwer, therefore it is, for no righteouſneſs makes any one righteous <hi>coram Judice,</hi> but a meritorious righteouſneſs, <hi>not regenerating grace;</hi> ſee how he ſhifts, he ſaid in his <hi>Minor, not regeneration, i. e. inherent renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which he all along aſſerts for our juſtifying righteouſneſs; and now he has brought it to the active infuſion of Grace, as he quibbles with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and why not Regenerating Grace? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that muſt precede Juſtification, and muſt not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs precede the Juſtification by his own Doctrine? and doth not the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> precede the effect; but what doth regenerating Grace preceed? Is it not regeneration it ſelf, it being the working cauſe of it, but as for the Grace of regeneration wrought, that's the very righteouſneſs which he means, and yet ſaith in his <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> not regeneration, this is but juggling, it is not plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>He goes on,</hi> not pardon for that comes after it, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith ſo I know no better authority for it, and I will believe it <hi>ad Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas calendas,</hi> I have ſhewed the abſurdity and folly of it, yea, and of his pardon preceeding Juſtification. <hi>And if none of theſe be the formal cauſe,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Eſſential cauſes denominating us Righteous in Gods ſight, it muſt be ſomething elſe:</hi> What's that? The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God revealed in the Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> Faith and Obedience. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith ſomething elſe. Imputation, its that which is the form, one eſſential cauſe, in this they differ, but as to the matter they agree; that Faith and imperfect Obedience, is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs whereby we are denominated righteous in the ſight of God, and is not the Grace of regeneration inherent; whether Faith be the righteouſneſs of God, ſhall be examined anon by its ſelf, becauſe Mr. <hi>H.</hi> puts ſo much ſtreſs upon it.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Arg. 2. <hi>Adam if he had perfectly obeyed, his Obedience had been his formal Righteouſneſs in regard to the Law, ſo is this ours in regard to the Goſpel. Again, works were the formal righteouſneſs in regard to the Law, therefore Faith is the formal righteouſneſs of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Goſpel. And two things go to this formal Righteouſneſs, Faith and the imputation of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> It ſeems Mr. <hi>H.</hi> underſtands formal cauſe, matter form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that is an effect not a cauſe, the <hi>materia formata,</hi> is the formal cauſe; I muſt tell him his Notion is neither Divinity nor Logick. 2. What conſequence is there in this Argument, works were the formal cauſe of Juſtification as to the Law of Works, therefore works muſt be the formal cauſe in relation to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, it follows not but <hi>vice verſa,</hi> and if the conſequence be true, then there's no formal difference between Law and Goſpel. 3. Hereby he yields that New Law conditions, are Old Law works, and conſequently his Goſpel is no Goſpel, but a Law of works
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41447:89"/>which is contrary to Scripture, and accordingly Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith, Goſpel works muſt merit the reward, as works ſhould have done in <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant; Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s reply is ſo weak, that its not worth taking Notice of.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. <hi>Juſtification hath a form, and that muſt be ſome righteouſneſs. Reſp.</hi> It may have a form, and yet Righteouſneſs be the matter. What righteouſneſs is it whereby we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? I anſwer againſt Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and him, that its no righteouſneſs inherent in the juſtification of a ſinner: He ſaith, <hi>its not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating grace infuſed, but imputed. Anſwer.</hi> What makes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference then between Sanctification and Juſtification? its nothing but the divers reſpect in Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Divinity, and wherein lies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, is it not in imputation? and this Logick he yields in his Notes,</p>
               <p>Argument 4. <hi>Divines generally fix it upon ſome righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> If ſome Divines ſpeak improperly, it doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to do ſo; but he ſaith, <hi>a diſtinction is made of a</hi> genus <hi>and</hi> differentia, <hi>and therefore righteouſneſs muſt be the form.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp. Non ſequitur,</hi> for <hi>genus</hi> is the matter, and but part of the form at moſt ſometimes, but the differencing part of the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the form diſtinct from the <hi>genus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith, <hi>the moſt plauſible Argument of all</hi> (becauſe it is Scripture) <hi>you have omitted, we are juſtified by faith.</hi> This, ſaith Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is my <hi>id per quod</hi> that runs through all my Books, its true, and what would Mr. <hi>H.</hi> have done to ſupport his Notion, if the Cardinal had not helpt him to this <hi>id per quod,</hi> and <hi>id propter quod,</hi> he takes himſelf ſafe enough between the Cardinal and Biſhops. Well, Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> is not ſo well pleaſed, I find, with his <hi>formalis cauſa,</hi> but rather than break with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> he will comport with him; eſpecially finding him very uncertain and unſettled, ſometimes our righteouſneſs is the formal cauſe, and ſometimes the material, and imputation the formal. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> hath another denomination for our own righteouſneſs, he calls it <hi>our ſubordinate righteouſneſs:</hi> Our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith, or accounting it to us for righteouſneſs. will be conſidered anon.</p>
               <p>§. <hi>Cl.</hi> alſo gathering and applauding Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. conſtitutive Juſtification, let it be a little inſpected, Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Mr.</hi> H. <hi>doth clearly diſtinguiſh his Opinion from the</hi> Papiſts <hi>in that he makes infuſed righteouſneſs only Sanctification, and imputation of the ſame to be Juſtification;</hi> its only to diſtinguiſh up our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſeveral ways: I would ask theſe Gentlemen whether they do not hold the infuſion of their righteouſneſs, and Juſtification upon it imputed; if they do, ſo do the <hi>Papiſt;</hi> for if the <hi>Papiſt</hi> did hold making a man's righteouſneſs inherent to be Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then muſt they hold ſome merit of condignity to precede in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41447:89"/>the natural man; for a meer free gift as ſuch, is an infuſion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Juſtification. I do not ſee but Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s conſtitutive Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is all one; for if they ſay, God infuſeth righteouſneſs, and imputeth righteouſneſs, its the ſame thing, and God cannot conſtitute any juſt by infuſion but he muſt impute him ſo. I have ſaid this conſtitutive Juſtification, as they take it, can be no other than Imputation if they will make it differ from declarative Juſtification. 2. <hi>The conſtituting us as juſt doth in order of nature go before accounting or uſing us as juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> God neither conſtitutes any man juſt in and by his own righteouſneſs, nor accounts them ſo; But we can ſay, God firſt gives us Chriſt's righteouſneſs by his Grace, then accounts us righteous therein, <hi>Conſtitutive Juſtification conſiſts in three things, in making us juſt, accounting us juſt, and uſing us as juſt,</hi> all theſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have, <hi>Therefore more fully, Juſtification is a judicial act, and that by the law of Grace, God by that Law, and the act of God's law, makes, pronounces, and by pronouncing makes a Believer a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, and being ſo made, accounts him ſo. Reſp.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of Juſtification of a Sinner, and therefore ſaith, <hi>its an act of free Grace,</hi> Indeed Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Juſtification can be no other than a judicial Act, its no way conſiſtent with Grace, becauſe he ſaith its by a Law and Act of it, whereby it makes and pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a believer righteous, and it ſeems he is firſt declaratively juſtified, and after imputed righteous, when God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him righteous, then accounts him ſo, <gap reason="foreign">

So as that, as Sanctifying it hath no form, and as Juſtifying no matter. Now this is a <hi>Quatenus</hi> with a witneſs, ſo in Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s ſence he doth well, making the matter real, and the form relative.

Enquiry about the Saints before Chriſts coming is, <hi>He would know of any Man who is moſt Orthodox in his Complexion, whether he does or is able to think that</hi> Enoch, Noah, Job, <hi>who were before the Law,</hi> Samuel, <hi>the Kings and Prophets under the Law, or any Man or Woman whatſoever before the coming of Chriſt, did ever imagine that they were righteous or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God for the Obedience which the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>ſhould perform on their behalf when he came into the World, and believing this was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of making him to be theirs</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And whether they did not look upon themſelves righteous by their own righteouſneſs, their doing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> means Men of the Orthodox complexion in his Eye, <hi>Neonomian</hi> complexions, I believe but few, if any for ought I know but are of the Opinion Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath declared himſelf, and divers others of that Orthodoxy; but if he means the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtical complexion, there's enough of them. 2. I would know whether or no they did ever hear of a New Law, and if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be juſtified by their own righteouſneſs, or whether they thought of any other Law to be juſtified by, than the Law of Works? For there was not the leaſt Word of any other Law before the Flood or after, none can be pretended to be, till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time at furtheſt. 3. Whether there was one Word of a conditinal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Adam</hi> after the fall, and whether he thinks not that <hi>Adam,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41447:90"/>Abel, Enock,</hi> &amp;c. Were not ſaved by Faith in that abſolute promiſe that the ſeed of the Woman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (who is the Meſſiah tho' not under the Name of Meſſiah till Ages afterwards) did they not believe in his righteouſneſs, as that which ſhould break the Serpents Heads, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the power he had got over Man by the unrighteouſneſs he had brought him into? 4. If they did look upon themſelves as righteous without the Obedience of the Meſſiah (or by the Name which the Spirit of God reveal'd him to them) why did they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Sacrifice for Sin, did they look at no Significancy or typical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, were they not taught of God ſo to do, and did he not ſhew ſhew them that they were typical of the great Sacrifice the ſeed of the Woman ſhould offer in the end of the World? Was it not by Faith they offered them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. And what was that Faith, was it not in a righteouſneſs? for <hi>Noah</hi> believed in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and became heir of righteouſneſs which is by Faith, what was he Heir of his own Righteouſneſs? did they believe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? <hi>The</hi> Apoſtle<hi>'s deſign is not to prove that Faith is the Evidence of things not ſeen, the Subſtance of thoſe things hoped for,</hi> that thoſe worthys lived in Faith and Hope, and dyed ſo not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the promiſe in performance, but ſaluted and embraced it by Faith. 5. Had <hi>Job</hi> and his friends ſuch Principles (tho' not of the <hi>Jews</hi> Church) <hi>chap.</hi> 19.27. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> was there no Faith in his Words, is there no righteouſneſs in a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? and what were the Sentiments of his Friends in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſure they were not <hi>Neonomians,</hi> Job 25.4. <hi>How can Man be juſtified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a Woman?</hi> Saith <hi>Bildad.</hi> A <hi>Neonomian</hi> would have eaſily reſolved this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, by performing of the conditions of the New-Law; but alas they heard not of this New-Law, this Nor-Weſt paſſage to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Let us conſider <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether he did imagine himſelf righteous, by his doing righteouſly, or looked to obtain favour of God thereby, and no otherways, and whether his Faith was not Eminently carried forth to the Eying of Chriſt in the promiſe. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Abraham rejoiced to ſee my Day, and ſaw it and was glad,</hi> he ſaw it, and ſaw it, and rejoiced and was glad, <hi>John</hi> 8.58. And where and how did he ſee it? was it not in the promiſe of his Seed? and what did he ſee in it? was it not the bleſſedneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed? <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and the Salvation by Redemption and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, did he ſee nothing in Chriſt for his own Soul; yes, you ſay he ſaw him as a <hi>Neonomian</hi> Cypher, to ſtand by his Juſtification by his own Works, to the magnifying his own righteouſneſs, but the Spirit of God ſaith; he was not juſtified by Works; how come Men to ſay he was? <hi>James</hi> ſaith he was, how, by approving the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41447:91"/>Truth of his Faith, for he was in a juſtifyed State long before the offering up his Son, but his Faith was proved, and approved of by God, and witneſſed to, by this eminent Act of Obedience, God teſtified to his particular Acts of Obedience, which the World was ready to Condemn, and ſo to <hi>Rabab,</hi> ſo to <hi>Phineas</hi> his Act, that whatever the World judged of theſe Actions, yet they were approved of God as righteous, and true Obedience: <hi>Abel</hi> was an accepted perſon of God before his offering, then becauſe his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was juſtified, God witneſſeth to his gifts, that they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as being done in Faith; whereas <hi>Cain</hi> was an unjuſtified perſon, theres no Sinner juſtified by his Works, but a Believers Works are accepted, becauſe their perſons are accepted in another righteouſneſs, in which their Works are accepted afterward: <hi>Abel</hi> was firſt accepted, and then his Service.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Now we are upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> let us conſider him a little further, did he imagine himſelf righteous without the Obedience of Chriſt, and no other way than by his own righteouſneſs? What do theſe Men make of the Goſpel preached, is it not the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt for righteouſneſs, for Chriſt is made Righteouſneſs to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. The Goſpel was preached to <hi>Abraham;</hi> what was that? The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. It was in the firſt promiſe whereby he was converted to God in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees, Gen.</hi> 12. In thee ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed, and that this contained in it, that bleſſing of righteouſneſs which is after more particularly Explained, he was juſtified as the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be juſtified afterwards, and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith theſe that are <gap reason="foreign">

Indeed the Myſtery was not ſo diſtinctly underſtood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5. Yet they were ſaved even as we, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. And how are we <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſaved? by becoming fellow Heirs of the ſame Body (<hi>i. e.</hi> myſtical) and partakers of his promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. The which participation the faithful before Chriſt was, the Goſpel had preached to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. The great cry is that Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> our working Faith, our Faith and Obedience is our Subordinate Righteouſneſs, or co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Supream, which our <hi>Neonomians</hi> pleaſe, for Juſtification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid <hi>Abrahams: Faith was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> i. e. ſay, they his Goſpel Works, not <hi>Moſaical,</hi> or not according to the Old Law, but according to the New.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:41447:91"/>
               <p>This aſſertion is moſt falſe, for theſe reaſons. 1. There was no <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days. 2. There was no New Law exhibited to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for their promiſe was abſolute, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. And cannot be pretended to be conditional. 3. Its not conſiſtent with the nature of Faith, which is the Evidence of ſomething not ſeen, or preſent, but Works and Faith as ſuch is both ſeen in us, and preſent with us. 4. If Faith be the very righteouſneſs, then Faith believes in Faith as righteouſneſs. Doth the Scripture bid us believe in our ſelves, or believe in another. Faith believes in Faith, for our very righteouſneſs by theſe Men, which is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, when they preach, they ſhould bid Men believe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, did <hi>Abraham</hi> believe in his Faith? Was that his believing, or did he believe that which was held out in the Promiſe? the ſame thing that God imputes to us for righteouſneſs, we do make the Object of our Faith for Righteouſneſs. Now then if God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes our believing to us, then we believe in our believing, theſe are inevitable Rocks this Doctrine will bring theſe Men unto. 5. God cannot impute Faith as a Work, and in the <hi>Neonomian</hi> ſence for righteouſneſs, it being as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> confeſſeth again and again, <hi>no righteouſneſs, ſinful, in need of</hi> pardon, for, 1. This would not be according to truth to call evil good, nor to do it in a way of adminiſtration of Juſtice, as in Juſtification, would it be juſt? But moſt unjuſt, God is a God of Truth and Holineſs, and the Judge of all the World, and therefore muſt deal righteouſly, for tho' he pardons Iniquity, yet will by no means clear the Guilty. 2. Its contrary to their own aſſertions, that Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an Act of Juſtice, whereas ſuch an Imputation and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they ſpeak of, would be far from an Act of juſtice, and is a meer diſpenſation with juſtice, for where a Law muſt be abrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or relaxed, there is an abſolute diſpenſation with Juſtice, and without one of theſe they confeſs there cannot be Juſtification by their New Law. 6. This cannot be juſtification, becauſe Sin is not pardoned in it, nor the perſon accepted, Imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to the work, before its to the perſon, and if the perſon muſt do good works before he's juſtifi'd, which is abſurd, becauſe the works he doth are imputed to him, and he is juſtified by 'em, as they ſay.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But let us hear what Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> hath to ſay for the Proof of this Poſition, that Faith is our Subordinate righteouſneſs (<hi>i. e.</hi> in his ſence an interveening righteouſneſs coming between Chriſts righteouſneſs) whereby we are juſtified before we come at Chriſt, or pardon, both being conſequent to our Juſtification, by this New-Law-Righteouſneſs which he calls Faith, ſee, p. 64. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are theſe, 1. <hi>What elſe can be the plain and proper meaning of that Phraſe, it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs?

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Doth Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> pretend to be an interpreter of Scripture, and will not allow the uſe of a Trope or Figure, but to call them Engines of Cruelty, is to ſay, where a Trope is ſaid to be uſed in a Scripture, there is a wreſting of Scripture; I muſt tell him that a Tropical ſence of many Places of Scripture, is the true plain and proper ſence and meaning of the Spirit of God, in many moſt eminent Expreſſions, and for this he muſt expect to be watched in the adjuſting his New-found righteouſneſs, whether he doth no where interpret Scripture Tropically. What anſwer will he give the <hi>Papiſt</hi> in the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation founded on, <hi>This is my Body?</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, its as credible as the Doctrine of imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs: And what ſaith Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> to the Covenant of Circumciſion. Well let us make a little Impartial Examination of this Expreſſion, <hi>If Abraham were juſtified by works,</hi> Rom. 4.2. <hi>he hath boaſting, but not before God;</hi> not in the Preſence of God for his Juſtification, yea he may rejoice, that through Grace he hath performed any action by faith which God witneſſeth to, as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, but he dare not plead it before God for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Perſon. Now he brings in Juſtification by Faith in diametrical oppoſition to it; for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, the words in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> may run thus, <hi>He believed on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, and he accounted it</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> what he believed of him) <hi>for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to him,</hi> the Words are rendred by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and the New Teſtament. <hi>Abraham believed God, it was accounted to be unto righteouſneſs.</hi> The Seed promiſed before was the thing believed by <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>bleſſing unto all Nations,</hi> which Seed was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his and <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife's Loins, this was the promiſe of God to him, and <hi>this was accounted to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> he believed Jehovah graciouſly promiſing, and the thing promiſed, Jehovah imputed to him for righteouſneſs <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>he believed the word of promiſe, and the thing promiſed was imputed to him;</hi> in this ſenſe the Apoſtle takes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6. where in both places he oppoſeth a righteouſneſs of faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> which is believed on, unto a righteouſneſs within which is no object of faith, for it is within us, and an object of ſenſe, he believed God in the Promiſe of Chriſt, and this that he believed was reckoned to him; he argues preſently that this imputation was not to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a work of any kind, for <hi>to him that worketh</hi> (as much as if he ſhould ſay, O do not miſtake me, I do not, nor doth the Scripture ſpeak of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith as

And why may not Faith be taken objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a Metonomy, for the thing believed? for 'tis not unuſual in Scripture, Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be our hope,</hi> the <hi>object of our hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. and ſo <hi>the hope laid up for us in Heaven,</hi> i e. <hi>the things hoped for, Coloſſ.</hi> 1.5. ſo <hi>looking for that bleſſed hope, Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>the things hoped for;</hi> what's more frequent than theſe Metonomies, yea proper, plain and elegant; in matters of ſenſe or perception its moſt frequent to put the object for the ſence, and ſence for the object, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.22. <hi>the light of the body is the eye,</hi> and there the light is for the eye, and after, the eye for the light; beſides, its a rule, that when a word in Scripture taken in the direct ſenſe, will croſs other Scriptures, and the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies fair for the Analogy of Faith, then the true ſenſe lies in the Trope; as here, <hi>we are juſtified by faith,</hi> but how? as it lays hold on the juſtifying blood of Chriſt, or elſe we contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>being now juſtified by his blood;</hi> now either Faith or the juſtifying Blood of Chriſt muſt fall into a Trope; for which is it fitteſt, and to which doth it ſuit beſt? <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 4. argues ſtrenuouſly againſt juſtification by works, and therefore, againſt Juſtification by Faith as a Work. To this kind of Juſtification he oppoſeth that of Faith, its being accounted for righteouſneſs; if faith be underſtood as a work of righteoſneſs, then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle contradicts himſelf, and maketh juſtification by faith to be juſtification by works, and ſo diſputes vainly, making no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if in Juſtification by Faith the righteouſneſs is imputed to us, and that be the drift of it, then his Argumentation hath the greateſt weight, the righteouſneſs of Faith is Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the righteouſneſs of works our righteouſneſs inherent, wrought by us, or in us, utterly excluded from Juſtification.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41447:94"/>ſaith their righteouſneſs wants pardon, and they muſt go to the <hi>id propter quod</hi> for pardon and acceptance: Now I would Query, whether if they could not imagine Chriſts Obedience, to be their righteouſneſs, how could they imagine that Chriſts Obedience could be the procuring cauſe, ſo that they were altogether deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the <hi>id propter quod.</hi> I would know whether the Faith of Gods Children before Chriſt, had no Eye unto Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, in the Sacrifices and ſin Offerings which they offered daily; did they not look at them as ſhadows and types of a better and more perfect Sacrifice, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith that the righteouſneſs of God (which we ſhall by and by ſhew to be the righteouſneſs of Chriſt) was witneſſed by the Law (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>) and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and if ſo, its ſtrange that they ſhould have no imagination of it, when as the <hi>Apoſtle Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> c. 1.10. Saith, the <hi>Prophets have Enquired after and ſearched diligently</hi> for this Salvation propheſied of, <hi>Searching what and what manner of times the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them did ſignifie, when it teſtified before hand the ſufferings of Chriſt and the glory which ſhould follow:</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> was clear in this Point, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.31 He ſaith that <hi>David</hi> foreſaw the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and ſpake of it, and Chriſt himſelf affirms this after his Reſurrection to the two Diſciples going to <hi>Immaus,</hi> that he <hi>ought thus to ſuffer and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Glory, beginning at</hi> Moſes <hi>and all the</hi> Prophets, <hi>he expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them in all the Scripture, the things concerning himſelf?</hi> Now if <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> yea all the Scriptures ſhould ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and expreſly foretel Chriſts ſufferings and reſurrection, and why it was? <hi>viz.</hi> to bear Sin and ſatisfie Gods juſtice, as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſa.</hi> c. 53. and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> and all the Sacrifices of old, and his Redemption was alſo for them, to the tranſgreſſions under the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. It is ſtrange that none of them from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt, ſhould in the leaſt imagine their acceptance with God ſhould be for his righteouſneſs, but that they ſhould look for Juſtification by their own righteouſneſs only, and none others.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> in the concluſion of his Book, undertakes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Imputation of the Active righteouſneſs of Chriſt, when as all a long his Book he holds that Chriſt's righteouſneſs Active or Paſſive, is not imputed but as to Effects; now he can mean nothing by the non-imputation of Either, but as to Effects: So that he muſt intend by the non-imputation of Chriſts active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, of the Effect, and then either it had no effects or no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, <hi>pro bono noſtro;</hi> now ſure if I miſtake not, he grants that whatever Chriſt was, it was for our good, and therefore have ſome benefit by it, and God reckons it a benefit, for that's their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41447:95"/>Imputation when we have a benefit, God reckons it ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes it to be what it is; ſurely if Chriſt active Obedience, did but fit him to redeem us by paſſive, it was a benefit to us: His Incarnation was it not a benefit?

               <p>Sect. 1. OUR <hi>Neonomians</hi> affirm we are juſtified by works, not of the Old Law (which the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> every were excludes) but of the New Law, this is that which we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſay the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth exclude all our works, even in the ſtate of Regeneracy, from Juſtification, and in this Point we ſhall take Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> becauſe he ſeems to be moſt full in the handling of it, and take up that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith, in a more ſcattered manner here and there.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Chap. 10. He tells us who it is that God Juſtifies, <hi>not ungodly,</hi>

                  <hi>according to</hi> Rom. 4.5. <hi>No ſaith Mr.</hi> Cl. <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God means the godly, and he brings againſt the poſition of the Spirit of God in this place, that of</hi> Exod. 23.7. <hi>Where the LXX uſeth the ſame words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> To which I ſhall anſwer, 1. That Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> knows the LXX doth not tranſlate the words according to the <hi>Heb.</hi> Text; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41447:96"/>ſpeaks to the drift of the Text, which is to enjoyn unto Men an impartial Execution of diſtributive Juſtice, and therefore it renders it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not juſtifie the wicked for a reward;</hi> and that is the plain Drift of the Text by what precedes, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt not wreſt judgment,</hi> and <hi>thou ſhalt take no gift, v.</hi> 8. and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the 7th verſe is, <hi>I will not juſtifie, i. e.</hi> will not have thee to juſtifie, for thou art but my Deputy, and I ſit in the Aſſemblies and Courts of Earthly Judges, and whatever Judgment contrary to Juſtice and Right thou paſſeſt, I will call thee to an account for it. Then 1. This Text ſpeaks of Man's Judgment, not of God's immediately, but as ſuperviſing the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men. 2. He might as well, or better alledged <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. where God proclaiming himſelf a ſin-pardoning God, ſaith, he will <hi>by no means clear the guilty;</hi> but in pardon of ſin God doth clear the guilty, and ſo the ungodly, in Juſtification of them by the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt which takes off the ungodlineſs in that kind, tho man cannot provide for the Juſtification of an unrighteous perſon by gifts or partiality in a way of Juſtice, yet God can by gracious and juſt ways and means provide for the acquitting the guilty, and juſtifying the ungodly juſtly. 2. It muſt be underſtood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. according to the words in a ſtrict ſence, <hi>God juſtifies the ungodly,</hi> while ſuch, not to remain ſuch. For <hi>Abraham</hi> there ſpoken of, was ſuch an ungodly vile Idolater, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. Had <hi>Abraham</hi> performed any New-Law righteouſneſs before he came out of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r?</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will underſtand it, he ſaith, in a ſtrict Law ſence, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he was a tranſgreſſor of the law of works, ſo will I, and that's therefore to be ungodly, and I know no ungodlineſs but ſuch, and while he was ſuch God juſtified him, and he did no New-Law works before he was juſtified, for <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. for by faith, when he was called of God to go forth he went; ſo that he had faith, and was juſtified before he obey'd the Call. 3. Its moſt conſiſtent with the Grace of God to juſtifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and not in the leaſt derogatory from his Juſtice to juſtifie a ſinner in Gods way of Juſtification 4. As God juſtifies none to be ungodly, nor juſtifies ungodlineſs, but that ſinners may be godly; ſo there's none can be godly before he is juſtified, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform one godly Act, nor have the Spirit, the natural Man being a ſtranger to God and Enemy to him. 5. Why may not God juſtifie the ungodly, as well as ſanctifie the ungodly, if God may give one gift to the rebellious, why not another? if he may give Grace, why not all Grace? they will have Men juſtified by works; who works in them to will or do? Who gives them this righteouſneſs? Doth not this gift of God find them ungodly? They will ſay, yea undoubtedly, then I will ſay, why may not God give
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41447:96"/>Chriſt, to an ungodly one the gift of righteouſneſs, and juſtifie him thereby, I hope if God can give one righteouſneſs, he can give another, unleſs they will limit his Sovereign Grace.</p>
               <p>§. 3.1. But more fully: And firſt Negatively, not by the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>viz.</hi> the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and why ſo? is there any the leaſt word of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> its <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, by the works of a law, any law; when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s law, he annexeth the pre-poſitive Article, <hi>So Rom.</hi> 3.20. its a law, <hi>from the works of a law no fleſh living can be juſtified;</hi> now this is not the Ceremonial Law, by <hi>v.</hi> 19. but that law whereby <hi>all the world became guilty, Jews and Gentiles, v.</hi> 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not guilty by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, neither could the works of the New Law admit of an exception here; for its any law that gives the knowledge of ſin. Now if the New Law gives the knowledge of ſin, the works of it are here excluded, for that is no law that gives no knowledge of ſin. Hence all works of all Laws are here excluded, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as the righteouſneſs thereof required is our obedience performed by us; whence its plain, that the Law of VVorks, the Ceremonial Law, and the New Law are equally excluded. Now the next Verſe hath it, that the righteouſneſs of God is manifeſted without theſe excluded works, this is no new Notion, but witneſſed <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The Apoſtle there doth peremptorily proteſt againſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the works of a Law, any Law whatever; and if he hath an eye upon the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> words, he explains them ſo far as to us, why the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> denies Juſtification to any man living, is, becauſe all works that Man can perform, muſt be referred to ſome law, <hi>by the works of a law no fleſh living could be juſtified.</hi> Let me add what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If righteouſneſs be by a law, then Chriſt died in vain:</hi> Its ſtrange the Apoſtle ſhould ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and poſitively exclude the works of a Law from Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet all this while intend that we are juſtified by the works of a Law, and that he ſhould never tell us, he doth not mean works of the New Law, nor ſo much as mention it.</p>
               <p>§. 4. From the forementioned places, theſe Arguments will ariſe againſt Juſtification by our works. 1. Juſtification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or ungodly one as ſuch, cannot be by any works of a Law,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41447:97"/>performed by him, but Gods Juſtification of any fallen Man is ſuch, for the <hi>Major</hi> its plain, againſt <hi>Neonomian</hi> Juſtification, unleſs they will ſay, that a natural Man may be godly while ſuch, or that which the old law calls ungodlineſs, the new law calls god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; yea, a man muſt be ſanctified in their ſenſe, before juſtified, while under condemnation, and bound over to wrath. Again, the Text is clear, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ungodly when juſtified, both by Hiſtory and the Apoſtles, for he could not do any good, and all his obedience was after his Juſtification by Faith. Now the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is as Evident, that Gods Juſtification of fallen Man is ſuch, for if we be juſtified by the works of a Law, its not conſiſtent with Grace; for juſtification ſingly conſidered, ſpeaks nothing but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: And Juſtification by the works of a Law performed by us, ſpeaks nothing but Juſtice; but Juſtification by Grace, is only as the Apoſtle ſaith, when its without the deeds of the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Doctrine that excludes the works of every Law, by which is the knowledge of Sin, excludes the works of every Law performed by us; but the Apoſtles Doctrine excludes the works of every Law that gives the knowledge of Sin. <hi>Ergo</hi> the works of every Law, Old, New, and Moral Law, are excluded. This Argument ſtands firm from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the holieſt Men have not expected to be juſtified by their own righteouſneſs, who have lived by Faith, then juſtification is not by works of a Law: But the Antecedent is true, therefore the conſequence. The conſequence appears, in that <hi>David</hi> had lived long by Faith, and in Holineſs, when he penned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. And if he thought to be juſtified by New Law works, he need not have ſaid, Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant, unleſs he had added, by the Old Law, but, Enter into Judgment with thy Servant by the New Law, for in thy ſight, New-Law works will juſtifie any Fleſh, <hi>Minor, David, Job, Paul</hi> expected not to be juſtified by New Law Works.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe works that will not make a ſinner clean and pure in the ſight of God, cannot juſtifie him; but no New Law righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, will take away Moral Pollution in the ſight of God, ſo as to make him clean. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Major</hi> is ſo clear as none can deny, for by Juſtification, the juſtified is purged and clean from Sin in the ſight of God; he can Enter into Judgment with God, upon the account of the righteouſneſs he is juſtified by. The <hi>Minor</hi> is true, 1. From the confeſſion of our Adverſary, that its a ſinful righteouſneſs, its condemned by the Moral Law, its not adequate to exact Juſtice, therefore it will not cover Sin from the Eve of Gods Juſtice. 2. From ſo many expreſs Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41447:97"/>
                  <hi>Job.</hi> 15.4. He that is righteous before God, muſt be clean before God. Imperfect righteouſneſs, can never make us clean in the ſight of God, <hi>Job.</hi> 15.4. Its not to be <hi>found of man born of a Woman, i. e.</hi> meer man, nor <hi>in any fleſh living,</hi> Believers are fleſh living, and born of women; <hi>Job</hi> ſaith <hi>chap.</hi> 9.30. <hi>If I waſh my ſelf in ſnow water, and make my ſelf never ſo clean, yet ſhalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own cloaths ſhall abhor me;</hi> now will <hi>Job</hi>'s new-law-works juſtifie him; he had been long a holy man, yet he often pleaded his uprightneſs towards God, and his integrity againſt his friends charge, and yet you ſee what his new-law-righteouſneſs amounted to, <hi>chap.</hi> 40.4. &amp; 42 6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let me add a Fifth Argument before I leave his Negative: If there was never any Law given to fallen Man that could give Life upon the Terms thereof, then there could be no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Juſtification by a Law; but the <hi>antecedent</hi> is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>conſequent,</hi> and both from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. the Apoſtle's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Argument againſt Juſtification by any Law. The words are very plain and full to any one that can conſtrue <hi>Greek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. He proceeds to his further Proof, in divers Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are many, ſo little to the purpoſe, that it would be loſt time to follow them particularly, but that there's in them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of Scripture perverted from their true Interpretation.</p>
               <p>His firſt Propoſal is, <hi>The whole ſcope of the Apoſtle is to aſſert and eſtabliſh Juſtification by faith, as the only way of Salvation to lapſed men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> What if ſo? Doth it therefore follow that the Apoſtle teacheth, that Faith is the way of Juſtification by Works? or quite contrary, that Juſtification by Faith is not by <hi>the works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but by theſe that Chriſt hath done? This I gather,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from that place</hi> Rom. 1.17. <hi>The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is revealed from faith to faith, which words I paraphraſe thus, That the Goſpel alone diſcovers the method and way appointed by God, whereby we may become righteous in his account,</hi> viz. <hi>by faith in Chriſt, and by continuance, increaſe and exerciſe thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Its the Office of the Goſpel, to teach Sinners <hi>the way, the truth and life,</hi> who is Chriſt; there's no other righteouſneſs that the Goſpel can teach a ſinner to Juſtification, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. and that Faith lays hold on that way, is the Goſpel; to teach a man that he is to be juſtified by the works of a law, is it Good News to a ſinner? That this Text is groſly abuſed, appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the righteouſneſs of God here ſpoken of, is a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs revealed, and therefore not in us; for things already in us, are not ſaid to be revealed to us.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:41447:98"/>
               <p n="2">2. Its <hi>the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> and not of Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its an objective righteouſneſs that is here ſpoken of, ſuch as is made known to our Faith by Revelation, therefore not Faith it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It appears by the Proof, in that the life of a <hi>juſt one is by faith</hi> feeding upon another's righteouſneſs, not his own. In a word, according to Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s ſence, it ſhould be this, The Goſpel is the Method of God unto Salvation, for therein is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of man revealed from faith to faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the more a man believes in Chriſt, the more he believes he is juſtified by his own works, and this is that he lives by, he lives by faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his faith to be works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He diſproves Juſtification by works of a law as inconſiſtent therewith, becauſe all are ſinners, and therefore none can be juſtified by their works, and on the other hand, that they muſt be juſtified by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> One would think this man ſpake now good Divinity, but his meaning is, only that Juſtification of a ſinner by the works of the old law, is inconſiſtent, but not Juſtification by the works of a new law; whereas the deſign of the Apoſtle throughout is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Juſtification of a ſinner by the works of a law, any law; he ſpecifies not any one law in particular, unleſs where he led to it, but when he oppoſeth Works to Faith in Juſtification, he ſpeaks of law indefinitely excluding all works of any law whatever, ſignified to us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>If there had been any law given, whereby life is given, then righteouſneſs had been by a law,</hi> but there was no ſuch law given.</p>
               <p>§. 6. <hi>The Apoſtle inſiſts largely on this Diſpute againſt Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by works, becauſe it was a received Opinion among the Jews, that a man might be juſtified by the works of the law, and it was retained by many of them, even after they were converted to the faith of Chriſt, as appears. Acts</hi> 21.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The Apoſtle inſiſted largely and ſtrenuouſly on this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, in making and proving the direct oppoſition between Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the works of any law performed by us, and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith in the righteouſneſs of another, 1. Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were generally bigotted to a righteouſneſs of ſome law to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them for Juſtification. 2. Becauſe they were generally ignorant of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which made them go about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs in Point of Juſtification. 3. What he writes to the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> he doth, 1. In order to convince them of the danger of joining their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in obedience to any law in Juſtification, with the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, and this was the danger of the <hi>Galatians.</hi> 2. He warns them of the vanity of the continuance of the works of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41447:98"/>law in order to Salvation. Now Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> brings the words of <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 21.20. to prove that the converted <hi>Jews ſought Juſtification by the works of the Law of works:</hi> To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the unconverted <hi>Jews</hi> did none of them expect Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the works of the law of works, for 1. They did not look upon their works as perfect works (though they took the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience to be what the law mainly looked for which Chriſt refutes) for they owned that their external works were mixed with much imperfection and ſin. Elſe 2dly. They could not own the Doctrine of Sacrifices for ſin, wherein they ſaw the ſinfulneſs of their works, and were convinced at leaſt thereof, whether they ſaw by faith the Antitype ſignified by them or no, and therefore could ſtand upon their works in themſelves perfect, in anſwer to the righteouſneſs of that law, but the Juſtification by works which they looked for, was by an imperfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (as the <hi>Neonomians</hi> do) in obedience to the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which they made their new law, as the <hi>Neonomians</hi> do the Goſpel, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that they ſought it as it were by the works of the law,</hi> it was Juſtification by works in their ſence, the Apoſtle preacheth accordingly againſt works, as taken by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. As for the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. they where for the obſervations of ſome things in the Obedience of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, as neceſſary means of Salvation, not aboliſh'd by Chriſts coming in the Fleſh; and as the Apoſtles did not preſs harder upon them in that Point, than only to leave them under an indifferency of uſing them or not, provided they laid not the ſtreſs of their Juſtification thereon, as appears by <hi>Acts</hi> 15. So here the charge againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> would have him clear himſelf of, was, that he contradicted the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in permitting the uſe of ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies as indifferent for the preſent, by reaſon of the <hi>Jews</hi> weakneſs, thou teacheſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to forſake <hi>Moſes:</hi> Now he ſhewed by his complying with <hi>James,</hi> that whatever he taught the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet he was not againſt complying with the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo far as to uſe yet ſome of <hi>Moſes</hi> his appointment, provided they made not ſuch Actions of theirs the righteouſneſs of Juſtification, therefore tells the <hi>Galatians</hi> running on that Point, that if they were circumciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Chriſt could profit them nothing. Now this is clearly the Point he withſtands <hi>Peter</hi> in, and oppoſeth the <hi>Galatians,</hi> in that he made his Saviour a Tranſgreſſor by his practice in judaizing contrary to the Doctrine he had preached in Juſtification, by Chriſts righteouſneſs alone: As for the others, they brought in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41447:99"/>another Goſpel, not one, whatever they called it. Hence the complaint againſt ſome believing <hi>Phariſees, Acts</hi> 15.5. was that they taught the neceſſity of keeping <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law unto full juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the conjoining our righteouſneſs with his, or that his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs meritted ours; and therefore they were to obſerve <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Law as their own righteouſneſs (the New Law with them) this Doctrine <hi>Peter</hi> oppoſeth in his ſpeech unto <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to which <hi>James</hi> agrees, and propoſeth an expedient, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. ſo that what the <hi>Phariſees</hi> attempted at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and what the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſeduced to, was only the neceſſity of the works of a New Law, as a ſole or ſocial righteouſneſs with Chriſts for Juſtification, <hi>Pro.</hi> 9.3.</p>

The reſtrictiveneſs of that place, we have ſpoken to; and ſhewed the place is poſitively againſt all works of any Law. Again, we have ſhewed that <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.

That a believer of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is bleſſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> Juſtified by Faith with faithful <hi>Abraham, ver.</hi> 9. to prove this, he argues thus; either by Faith, or by Works, not by works of a Law, any Law, for (ſaith he) he that is a ſinner, and under a Law for Juſtification, is under a Curſe, nor cannot come from under it by the works of it: And that you may take an inſtance of the Voice of any Law, take that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>curſed is every one that abideth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them,</hi> i. e. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>I grant,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a meer profeſſion of faith is oppoſed to works,</hi> James 2.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> True Faith, fruitful in good works, is oppoſed to falſe faith that has no fruits.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>I grant that even Goſpel-works are oppoſed to Grace, (tho not to faith) both in Election,</hi> Rom. 11.5, 6. <hi>and in Vocation,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Works of a law, by which a man claims Juſtification, are not Goſpel-works, but Legal, and they are oppoſed to Grace, both in Election, Vocation and Juſtification; but as Election is not on the foreſight of any works or righteouſneſs, no not of Chriſt's, and Vocation is not upon our performance of any works, no more is Juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I grant, God chooſeth not upon foreſight of good works, or faith in us, neither call any becauſe they have faith or good works, but that they may have them, his Grace is antecedent to any good in us; but now the caſe is otherwiſe in reference to thoſe priviledges which follow Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for God juſtifies and glorifies us, yet not as the meritorious cauſe thereof, but only as a way, means and qualification,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Well now the Caſe is altered, Grace goes no further than
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41447:100"/>Vocation, there it makes a ſtand, and man does the reſt himſelf; but let us enquire a little into this Myſtery: Is a man effectually called and made holy, and yet not juſtified? for he that is made holy in order to Juſtification, ſuppoſe qualified and conditionated for it, is in order of Nature, holy before juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> hath the Spirit of Holineſs, the Gift of Grace, and inherent righteouſneſs, whilſt a child of wrath, and actually under the curſe of the law. 2. All Juſtification for Holineſs, becauſe it is the work of a law, is meritorious righteouſneſs; for there's no law juſtifies but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the performance of the condition deſerves it in Juſtice. Hence all Qualifications and Means made legally, conditionally to the remunerative part of the Law are deſerving thereof, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, and undeniably ſo; for if the abſence of the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and the Means, or Non-performance of the Condition, doth merit or deſerve the Wages of the Sin from the Law, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the ſaid Qualifications or Conditions, then having, and performance thereof, doth upon the ſame Reaſon merit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Reward of Righteouſneſs; but the Antecedent is true, therefore the Conſequent.</p>
               <p>§. 9. He proceeds with Confidence. 2dly. <hi>I do abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that a true, Goſpel juſtifying Faith, and Goſpel-Works, are ever oppoſed to one another, and do confidently affirm the contrary, becauſe I have examined all Places where Faith and Works are mentioned, and do not find them, if any affirm, let him prove it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s Confidence is no Proof, and his ſearching the Scriptures, and not finding ſo plain a Truth, as that Juſtification by Faith, is oppoſed to Juſtification by Works; argues, but judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial blindneſs, whereby God hath hardned his Heart, and blinded his Eyes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As was ſaid before all Goſpel-works (as he calls his New Law Works) brought into Juſtification by a Law are legal not Goſpel, not accepted of God but leaves a Man under a Curſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that are Goſpel-works are Fruits of the Spirit, thro' the Gift of Grace, and Fruits of Faith, as they are Fruits of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, believed in to Juſtification; and no cauſe of Juſtification in the leaſt, neither doth the Believer claim Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereby, and hence called Goſpel-Works; but if he claim Juſtification by them, they are Works and oppoſed to Faith, but looſe the Name of Goſpel, are Legal, droſs and dung, and ſtink in the Noſtrils of God, neither are any ſuch Works the gracious Gifts of the Spirit, or true Faith or the good Fruit of it. For ſuch ſeek Righteouſneſs as it were, <hi>by the Works of the Law,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now whereas Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> here throws down his Gantlet in an
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41447:101"/>Ambiguous manner, we take it up in the true State of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and confidently affirm, that Juſtification by Faith is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively oppoſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to Juſtification by any Works of a Law whatever performed by us, the proving of which is the drift of this whole Diſpute as now managed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He ſaith, <hi>there was no Coutroverſie about any other Works, but the Works of the Law.</hi>

Mat. 5.17. Luke 16.17. 3. <hi>Its uſed Indefinitely, for the whole Body of the Law given to</hi> Moſes, <hi>and therefore he mentions it in ſuch general Terms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Becauſe Law is uſed in ſo many Senſes in Scripture, and thoſe that would introduce Juſtification by Works are apt to ſlip from one Law to another, and ſay, as Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> doth, that though the Apoſtle deny Juſtification by one Law, yet he intends Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Works of another Law; therefore the Apoſtle excludes our Works of any Law whatever, as frequently in his Epiſtles as hath been ſhewed, ſo in that expreſs and plain Place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had been a Law given which could have given Life, verily Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law?</hi> And why is it ſpoken? It's ſpoken as a Reaſon, that the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was not againſt the Promiſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> againſt Juſtification by the Promiſe and Gift of Righteouſneſs, no, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> taken together was ſo far from being againſt this way of Juſtification without the Works of a Law, that it witneſſed to it, as the Apoſtle expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. It did not appropriate the Grace of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to it ſelf, but by the whole Tenor of it witneſſed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Righteouſneſs. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> taken as a Law, did juſtifie none, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. For ſaith the Apoſtle, the Law (<hi>i. e.</hi> as ſuch) is not of Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. The Condition of it being Works, and therefore Juſtification by the Law is not Juſtification by Faith, the Apoſtle ſaying further, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>If the Inheritance be of a Law, than no more of Promiſe.</hi> ver. 19. For what end ſerved the Law given by <hi>Moſes? Anſw.</hi> It was added, becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, till the Seed ſhould come to whom the Promiſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41447:101"/>was made, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt, but why? added for two Ends. 1. That Sin might be diſtinctly known by the Moral Part, as the Apoſtle by the Knowledge of Sin. 2. That by the Ceremonial Law there might be a Typical Redemption and Satisfaction held forth unto them, through which they might have a ſight of Faith, and of the true Sacrifice held forth unto them.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Propoſition 5. <hi>The Law was looked upon by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Jews <hi>as a Covenant of Werks,</hi> Mat. 19.16. Granting that it was; yet not to be fulfill'd by a perfect Obedience, but by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as appears by his Words, <hi>What good thing ſhall I do that I may inherit Eternal Life?</hi> As much as to ſay, I have done Good and Evil, I would know what that good thing is whereby I may be righteous to Life Eternal. <hi>He depreciates the Law calling it a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Death and Condemnation,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7, 9. It was the true Senſe of the Apoſtle, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> or any other Commands of God, underſtood uſed, and applied as a Law for Juſtification by the Works of it, is a Miniſtration of Death, and not of Faith, and as a Ceremonial Law, which <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. is made nothing and by it ſelf perfect, it being Typical, and the Type abſolutely conſidered, could not purifie them as to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Apoſtle ſaith, it was weak through our weakneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. We being not able to come to the Terms of this, nor of any other; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. ſaith we, <hi>i. e.</hi> Believers are not <hi>under a Law, but under Grace</hi> for Juſtification, as much as to ſay, you take the Doctrine of Grace to be a licentious Doctrine but believe it, its the legal Doctrine that leads to Sin, not the Doctrine of Grace; beſides the Apoſtle ſhews plainly, that to look for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of any other is to be Married to it, which he ſhews <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. is quite contrary to our Marriage to Chriſt, by Faith, while we are in expectation of Juſtification by a Law, we are held in Bondage, but being by the true Sence of the Nature of it Dead to it, it becomes Dead to us; Now we are delivered from the Law, that being Dead wherein we were held, and there's no other Husband comes in the room of the Dead Law, no new Law, but Chriſt only. And the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi>) is only between the Law of Works and the Law of Faith, if he make the Law of Faith to be a Law of Works then its no Oppoſition at all, becauſe both are a Law of Works; and why I pray is Juſtification by Faith, Juſtification by Works, doth the Apoſtle ſpeak any where of a new Law or the Works of it? No he ſpeaks of the Law of Faith. Let us ſee then what is in that Expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27, 28.</p>
               <p>§. 12. <hi>The Apoſtle having told us, how we are Juſtified freely by Grace, who are Sinners in all reſpects,</hi> ver. 24, 25, 26. Infers,

By what Law? doth any Law ſhut out boaſting? No ſaith the Apoſtle, doth not Works? Nay, they cauſe boaſting what Law then? Such a Law, if you will have a Law, as the Nature of Faith, its in the very Nature of Faith to ſhut out Works; therefore we conclude, that we are juſtified by Faith without the Works of a Law; is not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith and Works here plainly oppoſed? Now that Law is taken for the Nature of a Thing, many Inſtances might be given, but for the preſent take <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. The Law, is the Nature of the Spirit of Life that is in Chriſt. Let us ſee what Senſe it will be in the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Interpretation, where is boaſting then? it is excluded, by what Law? Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Old Law of Works, nay; but by the Works of the New Law Work, excludes boaſting of Works, boaſting is excluded not by the Law of Works, but by the Law of Works; therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a Man is juſtified by Works without Works, not by ſome, but by other Works.</p>
               <p>§. 13. Propoſition 6. <hi>The Works or Deeds of this Law are ſuch as are performed by our own Strength in Obedience thereto, ſuch as</hi> Adam <hi>had in the State of Innocency, hence called their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Rom. 10.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> I enquire whether giving Strength and Power to perform Works hinders them from being Works of the Law, or would it have hindred <hi>Adams</hi> had he ſtood, and I marvel that any Man will ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had not Strength given him by God, but whether he had or had not, it makes nothing to the Point in Hand, which is the Conſideration of the Reſpect or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Works have to the Law, which enquire not how a Man came by his Money, but whether it be Good and Current, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. is falſly explained, as we ſhall ſhew anon; neither doth the Spirit of God ſavingly ſtrengthen us to the performance of any Works of our own for Juſtification, and ſuch as any Man claims by, are not Goſpel-Obedience nor performed by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>§. 14. Propoſition 7. <hi>They were ſuch Works as did admit of boaſting,</hi> Rom. 3.27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>For what we do of our ſelves without the help of another we may boaſt of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Can it be ſuppoſed that any underſtanding <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> do think they can do good upon a meer natural or moral Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration without Help and Strength from God. 2. How ſhall Men know they have ſupernatural Aſſiſtance, its certain they have it not graciouſly, when they aim by their Duties to ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for juſtifying Righteouſneſs. 3. The boaſting ſpoken of in the Places mentioned, is glorying before God ſitting on a Throne
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41447:102"/>of Juſtice diſpenſing it by a Law, now that Perſon that doth come with his own Righteouſneſs in his own Hand, and will ſay here are my Works, Faith, Obedience, Repentance, Sincerity perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, juſtifie me for them, or by them, this is the glorying the Apoſtle excludes, and Faith always excludes, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, Gods giving the Reward upon theſe Terms is paying of a Debt, and not of Grace, for whatever is demandable upon our own Performances in a way of Juſtice is not of Grace. The Apoſtle to <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. ſpeaks <hi>v.</hi> 7. of God ſhewing forth the Riches of his Grace in Juſtification (as appears by foregoing Context) of vile miſerable Sinners, and ſaith, its in his kindneſs to us thro' Chriſt, and then <hi>v.</hi> 8. gives the Reaſon, <hi>For by Grace are we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> (Juſtification being an eminent part of Salvation) <hi>through Faith</hi> (receiving that Juſtification and Salvation) now leaſt any one ſhould call this Faith, Works, as the <hi>Neonomians</hi> do, he poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively excludes all Works, and not of Works, not through Faith as a Work, and leaſt any one ſhould ſay, he is beholding only to himſelf for his Faith; he tells us, its a Gift of God, and its a Gift of Sanctification not of Juſtification as appears by the Text, that's only the Object of Faith, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 15. Propoſition 8. <hi>Theſe Works</hi> [viz. of the Old Law] <hi>are meritorious, implied in that Deſcription,</hi> Rom. 10.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The Deſcription the Apoſtle gives there of Legal Works is ſuch as belongs to all Law-works, for there's no Law that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins perſonal Obedience for the Condition, let it be more or leſs, but it makes the ſaid Obedience meritorious, and the promiſed Reward a Debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. and this Merit belongs not only to the Law of Works at firſt, but to all Works of any Law for Juſtification, theſe are the Works a Man may boaſt of, tho' he receive them as Gift from another, for if a Man gives the Grace of God in Works, in payment to the Law of God, he paies God you will ſay in his own Coyn, but yet his preſenting them to God for Juſtification, in Satisfaction to a Law, is high abuſe of the Grace of God perverting to an end that God never intended. The Law of Faith, which he tells of was never intended to be a Law of Works, for the Apoſtle uſeth it in Oppoſition to Works, and to prevent the Miſtake theſe Men are run upon, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould underſtand the Work of Faith to be meant by him, where he ſaith, it is of Faith that it may be of Grace, becauſe Faith aſcribes nothing to it ſelf as fulfilling to any Law, it is ſaid by the Law of Faith, either according to the nature of true Faith, as hath been ſaid, or elſe according to the Ordination of God, that we ſhould be juſtified by Faith without Works, Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thing as to the End, and Means, doth not always make
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41447:103"/>it a Law of Sanction, God hath ordained to give Faith, to give the Spirit, to give the Relation of Children. Doth God give them in a Law, <hi>Do this and live?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 16. Propoſition 9. <hi>Theſe Works are perfect and unſinning Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> This is a great Miſtake, that God hath brought in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning VVorks for Juſtification, inſtead of perfect VVorks. 1. God never made a Law where ſinning VVorks, were the Condition of the Law, this would be contrary to his Holineſs and Juſtice. But if God makes a Law wherein he ſaith <hi>do and live,</hi> let the doing be more or leſs, perfect or imperfect, yet a Man doing the thing commanded, his VVork is rewarded as meritorious, and its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to the Law, that it is to be righteous in the Sence of the Law, and to be meritorious. He that performs the Condition of a Law, and he never ſins at all in the Eye of the Law, therefore all juſtifying Righteouſneſs in any Law is unſinning, therefore this Plea will ſerve no more for Ejection of the VVorks of the Old Law, than for the Ejection of the VVorks of the New Law out of Juſtification. Hence we ſee the pretence of caſting out the VVorks of the Old Law is frivolous and vain, becauſe they are performed by our Strength, which none can pretend to, no not <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, or becauſe they introduce boaſting when the VVorks of any Law do, when Juſtification is pleaded for thereby, they are meritorious, when the VVorks of any Law are ſo, or they are unſinning and perfect, when the VVorks, of any Law muſt be ſo, or elſe it juſtifies not.</p>
               <p>§. 17. Prop. 10. <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>many of them did Conceit and Fancy that they could yield perfect Obedience to this Law ſo as to need no Pardon. This he would prove from,</hi> Luke 16.15. <hi>and</hi> Luke 18.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is not to be granted, that a People that offered ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sacrifices for Sin, ſhould think they could yield perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of God. That of <hi>Luke</hi> 16. proves not his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, for Chriſt ſpeaks only of the Juſtification before Men by their external Actions, and he ſhews that neither their external nor internal would juſtifie them before God, and beſides, he tells them that which Men account Righteouſneſs, God looks upon as an Abomination. Nor that <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.9. for he there condemns, plainly looking for Juſtification by Mens own Righteouſneſs, and truſting to it. VVhat doth a <hi>Neonomian</hi> do leſs then they, when he looks upon himſelf as Righteous to Juſtification by his own Righteouſneſs? thence he gives the Inſtance of the proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and poor <hi>Publican,</hi> he ſaith, the <hi>Publican</hi> of the two lookt more like a Juſtified Perſon, becauſe he renounced his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and applied himſelf wholly to the Mercy of God, as a poor
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41447:103"/>Sinner not pleading any works at all of any kind. 2. It is to be ſuppoſed the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> did look for Juſtification by their own Righteouſneſs, tho' they looked not at themſelves as Righteous in perfect performance of the Moral Law; for if ſo, they could not have been ſo Zealous for <hi>Moſes</hi> his ceremonial Law, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part whereof, was the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood and Sacrifices, they could not but know that the very High-Prieſt ſinned, and offered firſt <hi>for his own Sins, and then for the Sins of the People;</hi> yea, that Sin polluted their holieſt things, and therefore Sacrifices for Sin were offered for them, yea, <hi>all ſprinkled with Blood.</hi> But they having ſuch apprehenſions of their Juſtification, as the <hi>Neonomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have of theirs; they fall under the ſevere remarks of the Lord Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They looked upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, as that which was their New Law for Juſtification by imperfect Righteouſneſs, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Old Law, as firſt given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They looked upon the Sanction of the Law of Works as to perfection, to be abrogated or relaxed, that God would accept them for their ſincerity in Imperfect works; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> in his unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They looked to the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> in all Obedience to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, for becauſe, 1. They looked for forgiveneſs by the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Sin Offering, meerly without looking to the Antitype by Faith. 2. They looked upon the moſt material part of the Law of Works to be taken up into <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, their New Law, now its Impoſſible but the New Law to them (if ever any ſuch thing was Exhibited and diſpenſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, which indeed (being ſpiritually underſtood, was the <hi>Jews</hi> Goſpel) therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they ſought Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 9. <hi>As it were, by the Works of a Law,</hi> tho' it was imperſeſt, yet the works of a Law, and never attained to a law of Righteouſneſs, and why? Becauſe they went to Eſtabliſh their own impertect Righteouſneſs, but ſought not after a true perfect Righteouſneſs which was not their own, but Chriſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3.4. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, theſe are engaged in a great miſtake, for they think to have a Juſtification by an impepfect partial Obedience, but they become hereby Debtors to keep the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Moral and Ceremonial, but ſuch as ſeek ſuch Juſtification by Law-Works, either Legal or Evangelical, (for the New-Law muſt be ſuch, elſe they were not ſaved even as we) <hi>are abdicated from Chriſt, and fallen from Grace,</hi> Gal. 3.3, 4. As for the words of the rich Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. And as to <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſentiments in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. They are to be underſtood only as to common account, and groſs Actions, not that <hi>Paul</hi> thought he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41447:104"/>was perfect as to Moral-Obedience, but that he was imperfectly righteous, by ſome degrees of moral obedience, together with his <hi>Moſaical</hi> Expiation for Sin, and this is no other than his New-Law righteouſneſs, hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>he was alive without the law once, i. e.</hi> he once laid aſide the thoughts of the ſpirituality and exactneſs of the righteouſneſs of the true law of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt it off, but was wholly taken up with a New-Law righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, imperfect, and that God would accept this to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when he came to ſee the true law, and what righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he muſt be juſtified by, or periſh eternally, then <hi>ſin revived,</hi> then he could ſee ſin with a vengeance in himſelf, and died to all Juſtification by his works, or by a law, of what kind ſoever it was.</p>
               <p>§. 18. <hi>There's one place yet behind under the branch of Negative,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> This place is againſt Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> for here are two things in it: He tells us of a twofold Judgment of God that he looked for. 1. That of his Perſon. 2. The regularity and ſincerity of his Actions and Deportment. Whatever Cenſures Men were ready to paſs upon him, yet he had <hi>the teſtimony of a good conſcience,</hi> as <hi>chap.</hi> 1. but whatever his ſimplicity and godly ſincerity was, he expected not to be juſtified by it; but it might be ſaid, your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are condemned by men, and <hi>there's none that doeth good and ſinneth not,</hi> and ſo may you in diſcharge of your Apoſtleſhip: He ſaith, as to my actions, God knows what they are, and he will teſtifie to them before the World that condemns them, when he ſhall come and lay open the ſecret and hidden things of darkneſs; therefore he diſowns plainly Juſtification by New-law-works, and he appeals plainly to the Judgment of God, as to his ways and works, to be ſuch wherein he is Evangelically, thro Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God, as ſuch as are regular, ſincere, and from a true Principle, renouncing Juſtification thereby, but deſiring to walk in all well-pleaſing to God in Sanctification.</p>
               <p>§. 19. It is now time to look back a little, and take notice of the great Challenge Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> makes, <hi>I do abſolutely deny true Goſpel works and juſtifying faith are oppoſed one to another;</hi> which is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly made as to the Terms, whereas, Juſtifying-Faith and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Works, as the fruits of juſtifying are conſentaneous, as Cauſe and Effects, and therefore as ſuch, in their due place, they are not oppoſite one to another; but let the Queſtion be ſtated right, and we will receive the Challenge, <hi>Whether the Scripture doth not oppoſe faith and works, as ſuch, of all ſorts in the point of Juſtification?</hi> We affirm that it doth, and a little Logick-Light here is not amiſs, to conſider that diſtinguiſhing Properties of Oppoſites for diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41447:104"/>Arguments are <hi>diverſa vel oppoſita, diverſa</hi>'s diſſent only in a certain reſpect, may be in the ſame ſubject at the ſame time; a man may be rich and wiſe too, in a different reſpect, at the ſame time. But as for <hi>oppoſites,</hi> they do diſagree both in reſpect, and indeed really in their nature, and muſt have their proper diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Properties, which are, that they cannot be attributed to the ſame thing, to the ſame place, and in the ſame reſpect, nor at the ſame time; ſo that one of the <hi>oppoſites</hi> being affirmed, the other muſt be denied. Now then, according to the true logical accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>works</hi> in Juſtification, they are oppoſed expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, and they are <hi>contraria oppoſita unum uni &amp; adverſa contraria affirmantia quae inter ſe velut è regione perpetuò adverſantur.</hi> Now then,</p>
               <p>Arg. 1. <hi>If Faith and Works of a Law are not oppoſed in Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then a Man may be juſtified by Faith and Works in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, and in the ſame reſpect:</hi> But the conſequence is not true, the <hi>minor</hi> is proved, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not intend that any Man is juſtified at the ſame time, and in the ſame reſpect, by Faith and Works too; for then all his diſpute againſt one and for the other, would be very unfair, to ſay a Man is not juſtified by the Works of a Law, and yet that he is juſtified by the Works of a Law, let us take <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. a concluſion drawn from the Excluſion of the deeds of a Law from Juſtification, therefore we conclude that a Man is juſtified by Faith, without the deeds of a Law. Let Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> conſtrue it better if he can: <hi>yes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>his meaning is without the deeds of the Law of Innocency, but not without the deeds of the New Law;</hi> i. e. <hi>the Law of Faith:</hi> Its ſtrange the Apoſtle ſhould ſpeak then Excluſively, of all works indefinitely; the Apoſtle might as well have ſaid, therefore we conclude a Man is juſtified by the deeds of a Law, and it had been a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable concluſion, ſeeing he juſt before had mentioned the Law of Faith, by which might be underſtood only the Nature and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Faith, as a receptive Grace of the objective Grace of Juſtification: It is plain, the Apoſtle hath not the leaſt intention to underſtand the Fruit of Faith, nor Faith as a Work of a Law, for if he had, he would not have ſaid ſo poſitively, therefore we conclude that a Man is juſtified by Faith, without the deeds of a Law; and its impoſſible to ſpeak any thing as oppoſites, if theſe are not ſo ſpoken, they are not ſpoken as <hi>diverſa,</hi> but one is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the Subject, and the other abſolutely denyed, a Man cannot be juſtified by Faith in the Apoſtles ſence, and by Works at once; but if Faith juſtifie as works, then Works and Faith are the ſame in the Apoſtles ſenſe, and to be juſtified by Faith and by Works the ſame, and ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks non-ſenſe.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:41447:105"/>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>That which excludes Works of a Law in Juſtification, is oppoſed to Works of a Law in Juſtification; but Faith excludes Works of a Law in Juſtification:</hi> Ergo, and <hi>Minor,</hi> Its the Law, Nature and Ordination of Faith to exclude Works, or it ſelf as a Work, yea. Faith becomes uſeleſs in Juſtification, its abdicated from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, if it puts in as a work of a Law, yet it cannot be a Goſpel work, nor can any other work be ſo, that puts in for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; it is impoſſible any thing ſhould have a jot of Goſpel in it, that is a deed of a Law for Juſtification, it is a legal work, it makes it ſo. It is the greateſt contradiction in the world to ſay, we are juſtified by our Goſpel works.</p>
               <p>Again, to prove the <hi>Minor</hi> further, <hi>That which excludes the deeds of a law by an eſſential proparty, is oppoſite to works; but the law, nature or ordination of faith excludes the deeds of a law by an eſſential property, viz. boaſting in claiming the reward for the work done;</hi> this faith, or the law of faith doth, it renounceth all ſelf-righteouſneſs, and renounceth it ſelf; as ſuch it comes to Chriſt, and for his righteouſneſs, naked and empty; its not true faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be ſo, unleſs it take Chriſt only for himſelf, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs alone to Juſtification.</p>
               <p>§. 20. Arg. 3. <hi>Faith alſo is oppoſed to works,</hi> Rom. 4.5. <hi>where the righteouſneſs of faith is imputed to him that worketh not, but is ungodly;</hi> there faith is oppoſed to works, but in the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>Abraham</hi> it was ſo, and is ſo in every Believer, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtle, for Juſtification cannot be there by faith as a work, for then it were falſe to ſay, <hi>righteouſneſs is imputed to him that worketh not,</hi> viz. <hi>for Juſtification;</hi> for if faith juſtifieth as a work, then God juſtifieth him that worketh.</p>
               <p>Arg. 4. <hi>If faith and works in the point of Juſtification evacuate one another, then they are oppoſed, but faith and works do thus evacuate each other,</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. The <hi>conſequence</hi> cannot be denied, where one deſtroys another they cannot be together in the ſame ſubject, therefore contrary; for the <hi>Minor</hi> the Apoſtle is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. <hi>if they that be of the law be heirs, i. e.</hi> thoſe that are of the works of the law for Juſtification, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>faith is evacuated, and the promiſe abdicated;</hi> for faith making it ſelf a work, is <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> and throws off the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and takes the reward as Debt, and not of Grace.</p>
               <p>§. 21. Arg. 5. <hi>That which is not of faith in Juſtification, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to faith in Juſtification, at leaſt</hi> in genere diſparatorum, <hi>but the law and deeds of it is not of faith,</hi> i. e. <hi>he that works for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification on legal terms, is not one that's juſtified by faith:</hi> And what's theſe terms, <hi>the man that doth them ſhall live in them;</hi> now then, if its of faith to ſay, I am of the works of a law, and I ſhall live
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41447:105"/>in my faith, becauſe its the term of a law, if ſo, the law ſhould be of faith, and faith of the law, contrary to the Apoſtle, <hi>Galatians</hi> 3.12.</p>
               <p>Arg. 6. <hi>There's nothing more plain than the oppoſition the Apoſtle makes between Juſtification by faith and works,</hi> Gal. 2.16. The Apoſtle ſays it was a known thing to <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles, that a man is not juſtified by the works of a law (if he meant an exception of the law of faith, why did he not expreſs it) but by the faith of Jeſus; wherefore is this <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> if no oppoſition between faith and works in Juſtification? (he ſhould have ſaid in the <hi>Neonomian</hi> ſenſe, knowing we are not juſtified by the works of a law, but by the works of the law of faith.) we have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt (now leaſt any ſhould ſay, this faith in Chriſt is a work of the new law) he ſaith, <hi>and not by the works of a law, for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified by them.</hi> Now I pray, were any ſaved under the Old Teſtament, they will ſay preſently, yes, by the works of the New Law; nay, but the Spirit of God ſaith poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>no fleſh living</hi> was ever juſtified, no not by a new law. VVill any man dare then to venture his Juſtification upon works of a law old or new? Doth the Apoſtle ſay, we have believed in Jeſus that we may be juſtified by the works of the law of faith? So he ſhould have ſaid to have expreſſed his meaning in theſe mens ſence: <hi>No,</hi> he ſaith, to prevent all miſtakes in this kind, <hi>not by the work of a law,</hi> and he proves it: And he adds, for Conviction of <hi>Peter</hi> of his Error in complying with the <hi>Judaizing</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>if we,</hi> i. e. you and I, <hi>ſeek to be juſtified by Chriſt, we are worſe, are found tranſgreſſors,</hi> by endeavouring by our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to build People up in Juſtification by their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the works of a law, which we have deſtroyed by our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p>§. 22. Arg. 7. <hi>The oppoſition is full,</hi> Rom. 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>where the righteouſneſs of a law is directly oppoſed to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith as two righteouſneſſes oppoſite in Juſtification;</hi> there is an oppoſition: But in the Juſtification of a ſinner, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith and works are ſo oppoſed in the ſaid place for <hi>by the righteouſneſs of a law,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified in the ſight of God,</hi> he ſhould have added his exception, if he had intended men were to be juſtified by the righteouſneſs of the new law, and his reaſon is, that <hi>by a law is the knowledge of ſin. i. e.</hi> conviction of ſin, but no remedy; for the law only makes a ſinner guilty before God and his own Conſcience; but how then juſtified? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is by another righteouſneſs (the gift of God) which we have not performed, but which is received by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41447:106"/>faith, therefore called <hi>the righteouſneſs of God which is by faith,</hi> [without our law-performances] but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt who fulfilled the law, this is that which is in and upon every Believer; <hi>But,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Cl. I infer, we are not juſtified by the active righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> (p. 46.) <hi>or his obedience to the law of works imputed to us— for then we are juſtified by the law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The ſame inference will hold if only the paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt be imputed; for what was that but fulfilling the Covenant of Works in Satisfaction. All that Chriſt did or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered was obedience to <hi>the Covenant of Works,</hi> and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is juſtifying to us before God <hi>in foro legis,</hi> the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Law and Goſpel lying here, in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>That our righteouſneſs for Juſtification is not of our own performance of obedience to the law,</hi> for that is legal only; but our Goſpel-righteouſneſs is Chriſt's perfect performance of the moſt legal righteouſneſs, and this freely beſtowed on us, and received by faith.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>Sect. 1. I Shall here take Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in hand, becauſe I find he is moſt poſitive in the denial of it upon all accounts, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he tells us of imputation of effects, which are not imputable,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41447:106"/>and beſides is a total denial of Imputation of Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs it ſelf. His Arguments are 1. Taken from the places of Scripture that ſeem to evince the imputation of our own righteouſneſs to us for Juſtification. VVhat he ſaith of <hi>boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> hath bin ſpoken to already, the latter he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many <hi>Good Morrows,</hi> in a manner grant, whereby his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is eradicated by the Apoſtle, He tells us, <hi>the large extent of Chriſt's righteouſneſs to all the world in procurement of a law of Grace,</hi> which Doctrine I have ſhewed the abſurdity and vanity of elſewhere. <hi>It is manifeſt in Scripture</hi> (Mediocr. p. 20.) <hi>that good works, holy duties, and performances are accepted of God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is true, but acceptation of good works doth not prove juſtification of their perſons by them, nor the rewarding them; for <hi>Abel</hi>'s perſon being juſtified by faith, his ſervices were alſo accepted in the ſame righteouſneſs he was juſtified by, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded graciouſly in Chriſt; yea, his works were witneſſed to by God before the World; but ſuch approbation of works as the fruits of faith, is not Juſtification in God's ſight, in the ſtrict eye of his Juſtice. That place of <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments,</hi> where Chriſt anſwers him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true tenor of his queſtion, which was, <hi>what good may I do that I may inherit eternal life?</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> muſt needs ſay, that he ſought for righteouſneſs by an old-law righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which doth appear by Chriſt's Anſwer and his Reply. Indeed the whole of Chriſt's Diſcourſe ſeems clearly to evince that Chriſt confuted his Confidence in his own righteouſneſs, and convinced him of it, becauſe Chriſt gave him a Command that put him to the <hi>non-plus,</hi> and ſent him away ſorrowful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no proof of Juſtification, for he was not <hi>juſtified</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. ſpeaks after the tenor of the Covenant of Works, which requires perſeverance in good works, not at all of works or doing, as juſtifying righteouſneſs; that of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. ſpeaks of Gods acceptation of the ſervices of the Apoſtles, and rewarding them in Chriſt, but nothing of his righteouſneſs for Juſtification, which was Chriſt's only that he deſired to be found in; that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. hath the ſame import, <hi>come ye bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. it holds only God's owning and declaring the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the works and ſervices of the Saints, as performed by faith in Chriſt alone for the accepting their Perſons and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; beſides, it appears ſufficiently by the context they never brought their works to account for <hi>Juſtification.</hi> He brings in alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.26, 27. which is as little to the purpoſe. The Lord there anſwers a charge the People had againſt him, in not deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41447:107"/>uprightly, equally and juſtly with them, <hi>v.</hi> 25. which the Lord anſwers, That he always had and would deal with them that ſtood upon their own righteouſneſs according to the tenor of the law; if you are able to ſtand the teſt of your own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs you ſhall be tried by it, yea, I will deal not only righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with you according to my law, but condeſcendingly, if you are able to turn from ſin to righteouſneſs, and abide in it, and not turn to ſin again, but all this is to ſhew them their folly in truſting to their own righteouſneſs and ability to perform it, for he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>caſt away all your tranſgreſſions, i. e.</hi> there's not the guilt of any muſt ly upon you, <hi>and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit;</hi> where he challengeth them to do that which no natural man can do; but becauſe they ſtood upon their own righteouſneſs and natural abilities, God brings them to the teſt for their Conviction, that they might fly to his Grace both for Juſtification and Sanctification, which fully appears by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>chap</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. where both are ſaid to be of God, and not of our ſelves. He alledgeth alſo the tenor of the Law, <hi>he that doth them ſhall live in them, i. e.</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he ſhall be juſtified in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Now its ſtrange a man ſhould be ſo abſurd to bring the expreſs tenor of the Covenant of Works to be that of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, when its poſitively affirmed, that this tenor of the law is not of faith, directly oppoſed to that righteouſneſs of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. Nay, he is not content with this downright contradiction to the Spirit of God, he goes on. <hi>If you make a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, there is another Text muſt convince you, The juſt ſhall live by faith, to live by our faith is to be juſtified by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The man, I ſuppoſe, ſaid theſe things by roat, not minding the Text, he ſays there's another Text, but names not where, but its applied to the matter in hand, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reciting whereof will be anſwer enough to him. The Apoſtle was proving, <hi>a man is not juſtified by the works of the law,</hi> [per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly or imperfectly performed] <hi>is evident, for the juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> i. e. he that is righteous, is righteous by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith, and this is the righteouſneſs which his faith, as its food, feeds upon during his life of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>§. 2. His ſecond Argument is, (<hi>Medioc. p.</hi> 19, 20.) <hi>When this very Phraſe of the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs is not found in Scripture.</hi> So ſaith Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> That imputation of righteouſneſs is found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it cannot be denied, as in the inſtance of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. Now our adverſaries will grant us this Dilemma, that either it was Chriſt's righteouſneſs was imputed to him, or his own, not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41447:107"/>his own, becauſe he was ungodly when juſtified, for <hi>when he was ungodly,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>faith was imputed to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> what of faith? ſure it was no other than the thing he believed, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, whoſe day of expiation he ſaw,</hi> this was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. For if <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſt's day, it was the day of his Sacrifice and Expiation; for this end he came into the world, and the Good News or Goſpel preached unto him was Chriſt in the Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>and the ſame righteouſneſs the heathen was to be juſtified by, Ibid.</hi> Faith wherever its ſaid to be accounted for righteouſneſs, or wherever we are ſaid to be accounted righteous, its to be underſtood obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, and put for the righteouſneſs that it does eye and lay hold upon. But 2dly, Is not Chriſts righteouſneſs ſaid in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be imputed to us? let us a little examine Scripture: Firſt, whether its not in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. where Imputation is often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21, 22. obſerves <hi>Abraham believing the promiſe,</hi> viz. <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith, <hi>therefore it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> viz. the thing <hi>promiſed,</hi> and the thing <hi>believed, for he believed that God was able to perform what he promiſed,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thing promiſed was that which was imputed to him. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, do not believe you are told this, becauſe it was peculiar to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and none had it but <hi>Abraham, but its written not for him only, but for us,</hi> that have the ſame Faith, Righteouſneſs and Imputation, <hi>to us to whom it ſhall be imputed if we believe,</hi> i. e. <hi>receive that righteouſneſs by faith</hi> which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> received, <hi>embracing the promiſes,</hi> viz. believing on him that juſtifies, and on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt by which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; and then the Argument ſtands thus, <hi>The death of Chriſt for our ſins, and reſurrection for Juſtification, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> this none can deny, <hi>but the death of Chriſt for our ſins, and his reſurrection for or becauſe of our Juſtification, is imputed to every believer,</hi> as is plain in the Text, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.24, 25. and hence it follows, that all the Juſtification ſpoken of, and imputation of righteouſneſs, throughout the <hi>Chapter,</hi> is <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſs,</hi> the Apoſtle aſſerting here and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. that <hi>the Gentiles ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith as Abraham was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſaith we are juſtified by his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>and through faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 4.28. therefore, <hi>They that be juſtified by the blood of Chriſt, are juſtified by the imputation of his righteouſneſs, but we are ſo juſtified,</hi> by the places mentioned. Now then, none cna deny that Chriſts ſhedding his blood is his righteouſneſs, and we cannot be juſtified by it unleſs it be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and if any thing elſe be imputed, then not that; if Mr.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41447:108"/>
                  <hi>Humph.</hi> will ſay, its effective only, its <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in his blood,</hi> as in the blood of a Sacrifice ſhed for us, where in the blood of the Sacrifice is accepted, as if it were the very blood of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. <hi>That by which we have redemption is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but the death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt is that whereby we have redemption, and therefore that redeeming righteouſneſs is imputed to us,</hi> Rom 3.25, 26. Col. 4.14. but more of this by and by, for the Scripture is full of it, bleſſed be God. <hi>Neonomian</hi> Doctrine, I am fully aſſured, is far from Goſpel, as far as Darkneſs is from Light.</p>
               <p>§. 3. His third Argument againſt the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, is, <hi>If the righteouſneſs of Chriſt be imputed to us</hi> (as if it were ours in it ſelf) <hi>it muſt be the righteouſneſs of his active or paſſive obedience, or both, But its neither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> We ſay both: He goes to prove his active obedience is not imputed, <hi>If it be, then muſt we be looked upon in him as having committed no Sin, nor omitted no Duty, and then what need will there be of Chriſt's Death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The ſame <hi>conſequent</hi> may be corruptly drawn upon impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his paſſive, as he doth: But the <hi>conſequent</hi> follows not, for the Imputation of Chriſts active obedience, is upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal that the Law of God is not, nor cannot be perfectly kept by us; for if we were perfect in our ſelves, there would not need the Perfection of another to be imputed to us; for all Imputation by Tranſaction, ſuppoſeth the perſon not to be that perſonally, and in himſelf, which he is made to be by Imputation; ſo Imputation of our Sins to Chriſt, ſuppoſeth Chriſt was not Sin in himſelf, but made ſo by imputation of ours; therefore the Imputation of Chriſts active obedience ſuppoſeth us to be ſinners in our ſelves. 2. As Chriſt was the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> and made under the law in all reſpects for us, ſo he was to come under it for us as to active obedience, and to anſwer that way as well as the other, for it was needful that he <hi>fulfil all righteouſneſs for us;</hi> and the firſt and chief thing the Law required, was active obedience; the Law is not ſatisfied without a performance of the righteouſneſs which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; there muſt be therefore a fulfilling of the Law as to act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive obedience, elſe the righteouſneſ, of Chriſt is lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Its true, if the righteouſneſs imputed were inherent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Doctrine, then the inference might hold; if we are imputed righteous for our internal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that would bring us under this conſequence; but our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is of the active righteouſneſs of another, which makes us compleat in Chriſt, and without ſpot in the eye of God's Juſtice.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41447:108"/>Let me return the Argument upon him, <hi>If our active obedience to the new Law be imputed to us for juſtifying righteouſneſs, then muſt we he lookt upon in this righteouſneſs as ſuch as have committed no ſin.</hi> I hope Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will not ſay, that the righteouſneſs of the new law is not active obedience: I ſay, is it imputed or not? if imputed, the conſequence follows, but to ſee the baſeneſs of theſe men, to draw odious conſequences upon the Myſtery of Chriſt, when the ſame would follow with much more odium up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own Doctrine that they ſet up againſt Chriſt, their act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive obedience muſt be imputed to them for righteouſneſs, but Chriſt's muſt not be imputed to us. They ſay then, what need would there be of Chriſt's Death? We ſay, as much as there is of paying the wages of ſin where the law is actually broken: The law requires two things, 1. The death of the ſinner. 2. The obedience of the ſinner to the preceptive part of the law, both which Chriſt hath performed, and a Believer in him, as his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, Prieſt and Surety; and whereas he ſaith <hi>we muſt be looked upon as ſuch as have committed no ſin;</hi> we muſt not be lookt upon as ſuch by our ſelves; but there is no true Believer but is lookt upon by God <hi>in foro Juſtitiae,</hi> as if he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ſin; for if our ſins ſtand in the light of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in the eye of his Juſtice, we muſt needs be odious to him, whence is it then that the ſins of Gods children are caſt behind his back, and that they ſtand without ſpot before the Throne; and to conclude this Point, now let him conſider only one <hi>verſe</hi> of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by the diſobedience of one many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one many ſhall be made righteous.</hi> I would know of him what will become of ſo plain an <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> if obedience be not active obedience there meant.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>If Chriſts paſſive obedience be imputed, then muſt we look on our ſelves as ſuch who in Chriſt have ſuffered and ſatisfied the law, and born the curſe of it, and then how ſhall there be room for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? a man that pays his full debt by himſelf or Surety cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by the Creditor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> And here he would cover himſelf not to be ſeen a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian;</hi> we ſhall ſee how well by and by. 1. He lays it down as a groſs abſurdity to ſay, <hi>we ſatisfied in Chriſt,</hi> here and elſewhere often, to which we anſwer, that it is not abſurd for any man to ſay, I paid my Debt by another, <hi>viz.</hi> a Surety, for the law looks upon it as the payment of his Debt, and he is diſcharged by it. 2. He makes not himſelf the Surety, for he aſcribes the payment to the Surety, and the Debt to himſelf; ſo the words are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring himſelf, but honour to the Surety, therefore to ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have ſatisfied the law in their Surety Chriſt, is giving <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41447:109"/>to him,</hi> and a proper uſual Speech. But he infers with the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that then there's no room for Pardon; indeed it is eaſie to ſee how their mouths water at a plain Denial of Chriſt's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though they do it interpretatively as much as the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> you may likewiſe ſee the Deſign in dividing Juſtification and Pardon one from the other. Its true, when a righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is juſtified by his own righteouſneſs (as in the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Juſtification) there's no room for Pardon, for he hath paid all his due, and by his own Money; but it is otherwiſe in God's Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſinner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That is his Pardon, God pardons none but in Juſtification, <hi>we have forgiveneſs through the blood of Chriſt,</hi> tho Man pardons often with injury to Juſtice, but <hi>God declares his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Rom. 3.25. and <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion, Heb.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God's juſtifying ſinners, ungodly, &amp;c. by a righteouſneſs given unto them, is a pardon of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the higheſt, nobleſt Pardon in the World, where ſins are nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt, when it is to the Satisfaction of Juſtice, as Grace, ſo Juſtice are magnified therein: A true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and broken-hearted ſinner will not ſpeak in the proud <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> or <hi>Neonomian</hi> Dialect, <hi>O Lord, we thank thee not for, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Pardon, if Chriſt hath died to ſatisfie;</hi> with them, either Gods Pardon, or the Sinners Juſtification muſt fall to the ground; but bleſs God for the nobleſt Pardon in the World.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But methinks this Argument is purely <hi>Socinian,</hi> for they ſay, <hi>there's nothing more contrary to Gods forgiving freely than Satisfaction:</hi> But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that he might not ſeem to run a Tilt againſt Satisfaction, ſaith indeed. <hi>The Argument of the</hi> Socinian <hi>from Pardon againſt Chriſt's Satisfaction is not valid, but it is good againſt imputation of it to us, as if we had ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> And why is it not good againſt <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> ſence? he gives no reaſon, for he ſaith, that he that pays the full Debt by himſelf or Surety, there's no room for pardon; and will not Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſay, that Chriſt hath not paid the full Debt for him; if he will, let him pay what remains, or try for Pardon for that which is not paid another way than by remiſſion through his blood; but what do they <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay more; if God be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied where is Pardon? we ſay, God's Pardon is by way of Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Law; No, ſaith Mr. <hi>H.</hi> it is good againſt Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo the <hi>Socinians</hi> hold too. I pray, did Chriſt ſatisfie at all? if he did, was it in a law-ſence? if ſo, was it for himſelf, or for us? if for us, then the law ſaith ſo, for us: For the Law of God doth not take Satisfaction in ſo blind a manner, as that God in his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41447:109"/>Law knows not for whom it is; if God in his Law knows for whom it is, and accepts it for us, then it is accounted to us, and imputed to us, as to all the ends thereof in Law. The taking Satisfaction in Law for any offence againſt it for any one, is the Laws Imputation or accounting it to him for whom it is made, whether the ſatisfaction be given by himſelf who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, or any one for him; therefore if Chriſt ſatisfied for us, and this Satisfaction accepted by God for us, God imputes it to us, as if we had done it our ſelves, therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> muſt either renounce the Doctrine <hi>of Satisfaction,</hi> with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> or own its imputed to us as fully (yea in this caſe we may ſay) more fully than if we had made it our ſelves.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Let us ſee how Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would avoid the <hi>Socinian</hi> Rock, he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt may have wrought with the father (or made him that ſatisfaction as) to procure new Terms, ſo that a man may be juſtified as a fulfiller of them, and yet need pardon for non-performance of the old.</hi>

He makes not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction a payment of a Debt owing to the Law by us, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a procurement. a buying ſomething of God, whereas Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is for a wrong done. I may purchaſe a thing of a perſon whom I never injur'd, or if I have the Money whereby I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a new thing that refers not to the injury I did before, but to the new Purchace; obſerve then, he makes Chriſt's Satisfaction only a New Purchace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This New Purchace is of New Terms of Juſtification; hence God is not to ſtand upon ſatisfaction to the Old Law, but to drop it, and bring the Sinner under a New Law; Chriſt died not to ſatisfie the Law, but to tranſlate us from one Law to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whence the old hath no more to do with us, and thus all the world are tranſlated, therefore the Old Law is gone to all the World unſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Man is juſtified on the new Terms, they being fulfilled by his own righteouſneſs, but not pardoned on theſe terms by the New Law; and this is one of the greateſt inconſiſtencies in the World, to ſay a man is juſtified by a Law, and not pardoned; how is he juſt in the eye of that Law that doth not free from the charge of any tranſgreſſion of it, But</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſaith, he needs Pardon for non-performance of the old, if ſo, 1. The New Law is not an Act of Indemnity in reſpect of ſins againſt the old; for if a man condemned by one law, be taken from under it to a new law, he is indempnified from the old, elſe all pretence of advantage by the ſaid tranſlation is gone, for he that ſtands under the terms of one law, condemned by it,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41447:110"/>and brought under new terms to another, come now to be liable to the laſh of two Laws, whereas before he was under but one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>this Pardon muſt be had at the Bar of the Old Law.</hi> I would know of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> how? If he ſaith, and will ſtand to it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Argument, he cannot, or elſe he muſt deny Chriſts Satisfaction, which is this, <hi>That Law which is ſatisfied for the breach of it, admits no Pard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n from the Legiſlator, but the Old Law</hi> (ſay <hi>Neonomians</hi> in words) <hi>was ſatisfied for us, therefore there can be no Pardon; yea, it was ſatisfied for us in our ſtead, and the ſatisfaction accepted for us, yea therefore imputed to us,</hi> Here I have the <hi>Neonomian</hi> faſt in this Dilemma from their own Doctrine, let them free themſelves how they can. For if Pardon and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction imputed are not conſiſtent as to our Doctrine, then not in theirs; but they ſay, notwithſtanding their juſtification by their New Law, they muſt have Pardon for the breach of the Old, and how? Not at all in their ſence, if the Old be not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, or that Satisfaction not imputed; as much as to ſay, it is Money laid down in Court indefinitely, but not accepted in Court for this and that Mans Sins; hence Chriſt hath ſatisfyed for none, for all ſatisfaction as ſuch, is accepted as ſuch; we come now to his attempt, to prove that neither the Active or Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt is imputed.</p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>If that his Active and Paſſive Obedience be imputed, then muſt God be made to deal with Man according to the Covenant of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> See how this Gentleman in all his Arguings runs his Head againſt a Poſt and Pillar of Goſpel Truth, his Argument is this, if Chriſt's Active and Paſſive Obedience be accepted for us as ſatisfaction for the Law, then God deals with Sinners in their juſtification, after the tenor of the Covenant of Works; now he may aſſume either by taking away the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> or by taking away the <hi>Conſequent,</hi> he indeed intends both, firſt, by taking away the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> viz. But Chriſt's Active and Paſſive Obedience is not accepted for ſatisfaction, therefore he doth not deal with Sinners in Juſtification according to the Covenant of Works, therefore Chriſt hath not ſatisfied the Covenant of Works for us, the Law lies unſatisfyed. I would know how the Pardon he ſpeaks of is Subſequent to the New Law. Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is had, is it by dealing with us upon the account of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Old Law? He ſuggeſts that it is, then pardoned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are dealt with according to the Old Law, if not juſtified. But to have him in his Conſequences, he aſſumes that God deals not with Sinners in Juſtification upon the Terms of the Old Law, or Covenant of Works. To Anſwer, he deals with them
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41447:110"/>in Chriſt, according to the Terms of the Covenant of Works, but in themſelves as ſinners, juſtifying them in Chriſt according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works, it is meer Grace, the Myſtery of Grace is to ſave ſinners in ſuch a way, as may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifie rich Grace, but Exalt Grace, and that in the higheſt manner. Now the Exaltation of Juſtice cannot be but in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying a Sinner in the Eye of the ſtricteſt Law, by the higheſt and moſt acceptable Satisfaction thereof, on this account, Chriſts Obedience was the moſt Legal, both active and paſſive that ever was; but that a ſinner is brought under this Obedience of Chriſt unto Juſtification, is meer free Grace, he being thereby partaker of the diſtinguiſhing Grace of God, and the free Gift of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, without the intervention of any Mediator, or Subordinate Righteouſneſs of his own; hence it is, that his Faith makes not void the Law, but Eſtabliſheth it in the higheſt degree, in Exalting Chriſt as his only, and moſt compleat Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, moſt legal in ſatisfying the Law for us, as a Covenant of Works; he ſaith, <hi>when nothing is more apparent in Scripture then that by Grace it is that we are juſtified, and by Grace ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> But will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> affirm that Grace doth juſtifie us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Juſtice? Doth not the Apoſtle ſay a ſinner is juſtifyed by Grace, in and through Chriſts Redemption, that God may be juſt? Doth not Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſay Juſtification is an Act of Juſtice, again and again? Doth not this ſetting up our own righteouſneſs in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Condition of the New Law, make his Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Act of Juſtice, yea, and without Grace? What do theſe Men mean ſo often and poſitively to contradict the Scripture and themſelves, to draw their dirty Inferences upon the Truth, with holding it in unrighteouſneſs?</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>If nothing leſs then a Righteouſneſs as doth Anſwer and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Law fully, will ſuffice for the ſinners Plea to flee from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, he is not judged by the Law of Grace, but by the Law of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> The inference hath no danger in it; for 1. We know of no Judgment in freeing any from Condemnation, but a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in Chriſt from the Law of Works, before which every Believer is diſcharged here and hereafter through Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We know of no New Law, either to quit or condemn, a Law of Grace in that ſenſe is a Bull, Grace and a Law are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite. 2. He here inſinuates as if Chriſts ſatisfaction were compleat and imperfect: If nothing elſe will ſuffice for a Plea. 1. What can be better than a perfect ſatisfaction for a Plea. 2. Either Chriſts is not perfect, or elſe perfect will not do, without an imperfect added to it, which indeed he means,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41447:111"/>that Chriſts perfect ſatisfaction muſt have our Imperfect added, to make our Plea compleat. 3. What is freeing from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation but Pardon of Sin? I pray, what righteouſneſs doth a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onomian</hi> flee to for the pardon of Sin? Do they tell us its Chriſts, tho' they be juſtified by their own? I would know whether they eſteem Chriſts Righteouſneſs full and compleat for the pardon of Sin? Or do they plead for ſome of their pardon at the Bar of the New Law, where they are juſtifyed, and ſome of their pardon at the Bar of the Old Law, where they are condemned? But this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs is a miſtake of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (poor Man I pitty him) and he hath found the miſtake, ſo it ſeems indeed by his Writing.</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>Chriſt came into the World to procure and tender a New Law, and in this regard he is called our Law giver; not that he hath given any other Moral rules of Life to us, but that he hath given the ſame Precepts, with Indulgence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Now mark the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Spirit, but Two or Tree Lines off he was for Juſtification only by Grace without Law, that he might dethrone Chriſt, but now again, that he may Enthrone Mans Righteouſneſs, he is altogether for Law, his Language is half Aſhdod, take him where you will. 1. He tells you what he means by Satisfaction, which he ſaith is procurement, Chriſt came into the World not to ſatisfie the Law of God, which we had broken, but to procure a Law, a remedial Law, a better Law to anſwer Gods Ends than the Firſt; it was a great miſtake ſure in Divine Wiſdom to make ſuch a Law at firſt as would not do. 2. It was another overſight at leaſt that Chriſt did not come to procure a right law at firſt. 3. Its very ſtrange that God would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a right law without procurement, Laws are not uſed to be purchaſed or procured; Legiſlators make Laws according to their pleaſure, without procurement. 4. And wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t's the World the better? Chriſt hath procured the putting the World under New-Law Terms, and not ſatisfied the Old Law, and now they muſt perform the condition of the New Law, and be pardoned by the old Law unſatisfied, elſe they cannot be ſaved. 5. After all the noiſe about ſaving by Grace, its but by a law which requires perſonal obedience in fulfilling the condition; this is the Grace of the Law, and Law of Grace; a Law of Grace it is, ſuch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Grace is no more Grace, and the Law is no more a Law, that indeed a law of Grace is a Contradiction in <hi>proprio adjuncto,</hi> a meer Hobgoblin. But how is theſe mens New Law compounded? It is, they ſay, of Grace and a Law; and it lies <hi>In that he hath not given new Moral Laws of life to us, other than what was contained in the old law before; but that he hath given the ſame precepts with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:41447:111"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Well, Chriſt is not our Lawgiver according to purchaſe (for theſe Men make Chriſt to have died for himſelf, to make himſelf a Lawgiver) to deviſe and conſtitute any new Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, but firſt to pluck down the old houſe, and then to take the broken and ſcattered pieces, and make a new one; he takes the Moral Materials of the old Law, cuts and hews them pretty much, makes the Duties more indifferent, the ſins forbidden Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and allowable, yea neceſſary, to come into the righteouſneſs of the new law; for if the Condition be not mixt of Morality and Immorality its good for nothing, it will not ſerve this turn, therefore the old law with indulgence of ſin is the New Law. I pray let me know from the Wits of our Age, whether this be not <hi>Antinomianiſm?</hi> Now he tells us, <hi>this is a law of indulgence,</hi> &amp;c. the plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it is, that its a Law of Diſpenſation with a Law of Juſtice, <hi>i. e.</hi> a lawleſs law; that all the Satisfaction he means, is Gods Diſpenſation with Law and Juſtice, and a law to call Sin by one law Sin, and righteouſneſs by another; the truth is, the whole Doctrine tends to deny God in his glorious Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to change him into <hi>the ſimilitude of an Ox that eateth Hay, interpretativè,</hi> and if God doth not act now, and at Judgment, by this lay of Diſpenſation with Law, and indulgence of Sin, he ſays, the main buſineſs of Chriſt's coming and Redemption, is loſt, that can be no other in his ſence than to be Miniſter of Sin.</p>
               <p>§. 10. <hi>You ſhall hear a</hi> Proteſtant [i. e. <hi>Neonomians,</hi> they are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> according to the Profeſſion of this downright <hi>Papiſt</hi>] <hi>in his Prayer, appealing from the Tribunal of Gods Juſtice, to the Throne of his Grace, yet in his Sermon telling the People, that it is nothing elſe but the perfect obedience and ſatisfaction of Chriſt imputed to them that ſaves them, which is to bring them back from the throne of Grace to the Bar of his Juſtice to be judged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> I am aſhamed to read ſuch a Banter of Chriſtianity from any man that profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſtian, tho a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Socinian.</hi> 1. Is it a good Appeal or no for a ſinner to make from the Tribunal of Juſtice, <hi>i. e.</hi> meer Juſtice, where God beholds the Sinner as he is in himſelf, by his moſt righteous law, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned tranſgreſſor, to the Throne of Grace (not that God hath two Thrones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.) but from it proceeds a Diſpenſation of Juſtice, Thundrings, Lightnings, &amp;c. of Judicial Proceedings to his enemies, and a Diſpenſation of Grace to his Church, (there being a Rainbow round about the Throne;) where Chriſt is a High-Prieſt, who hath ſatisfied the Juſtice of God, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Satisfaction as our Advocate and Interceſſor? did not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> do ſo, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 2.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41447:112"/>Obedience and Satisfaction of Chriſt imputed to them can ſave them: Is this to bring them back to the Tribunal of meer Juſtice? is not this the Throne of Grace where Juſtice is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and appeaſed, where Chriſt the Satisfier is exalted to Gods right hand <hi>to be a Prince and Saviour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray, what do <hi>Neonomians?</hi> do they firſt bring them to a law, ſuppoſe it were a law of Grace, as they call it, to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own righteouſneſs; whither do they carry them then? is it not to the Tribunal of Juſtice to be pardoned? So that if God in Chriſt pardoning iniquity on the Throne of Grace, through the Shatisfaction of Chriſt, be the Throne of Juſtice diveſted of Grace: Why are <hi>Neonomians</hi> to be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, after they are juſtified at another Bar? But he is for the dividing <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> in a Sinner's Juſtification, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> are, or rather abandoning Juſtice.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. IN the laſt Place, <hi>There is a Righteouſneſs revealed in the Goſpel, that God goes by in his dealing with all the World, whereby it is that we are Juſtified in Oppoſition to the Righteouſneſs of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> If it be a revealed Righteouſneſs, it's that which is the Object of Faith ſeen without our ſelves not in our ſelves, for that need not to be revealed, which every Man is naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſee and know. Again, it muſt not be our Works in Oppoſition to our Works for Juſtification, for there is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Oppoſition between Works and Works, nor material indeed which have the ſame Subject, and Genns, and End; as for what he calls them by way of Difference, it will not ſerve, he calls ſome Works, Works of the Law, ſome Goſpel-works, <hi>i. e.</hi> Works of the Law of Grace; now we have ſhew'd that there are no ſuch Goſpel-works which put in for Juſtification, nor doth the Spirit Work ſuch, and being both are the Works of a Law, they differ not ſpecifically, they are legal Works, Works of a Law
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41447:113"/>performed for Juſtification are always Legal never Evangelical.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>This Revealed Righteouſneſs is in Scripture called the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, which the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>conceive to be the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt without us [all but</hi> Neonomians <hi>and</hi> Quakers] <hi>i. e. the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is not ours by Performance but by Faith, but neither</hi> Proteſtants <hi>ſince</hi> Luther, <hi>nor</hi> Papiſts <hi>ſince</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>have hit the Mind of the Apoſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> But the Scripture hath hit it long before <hi>Luther,</hi> ſure then, if they were not Right, the Reformation was the Deforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Doctrine; the Truth is, many of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were out in this Point; all our Reformation ſo far as I can underſtand Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and many <hi>Neonomians</hi> are gone, is not worth a Fig; and here indeed Mr. <hi>H.</hi> boaſts again and again, that he hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and I may truly ſay, that he and his Father <hi>B.</hi> hath, and in this only they differ from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that they go beyond them in Self-righteouſneſs, and in a moſt daring ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oppoſition to the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God and Grace oppoſed to Works, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Righteouſneſs of the Covenant of Grace accepted for Chriſts ſake, inſtead of the Covenant of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is not Chriſt's Righteouſneſs accepted for us, for that alone is the Righteouſneſs of the Covenant of Grace, and then only God did not ſet up Chriſt to ſet up our Righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was impoſſible for us to have any other to be juſtified by, that he might have the Glory of Being our Righteouſneſs alone, but he ſaith, this Righteouſneſs of ours muſt come inſtead of the Righteouſneſs of the Covenant of Works; to which we Anſwer, that its impoſſible for us to be Juſtified by any Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but that which fully and exactly anſwers the Covenant of Works, either our own, or anothers, the Righteouſneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law cant Juſtifie us there. For if a Sinner be juſtified, it muſt be by that Law which he hath broken, and by none elſe; if they ſay Chriſt hath ſatisfied that Law for us, then we ſay that Satisfaction is a ſufficient Righteouſneſs for our Juſtification, we look for no other Law to be juſtified by, nor no other Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for our Juſtification. <hi>He proceeds, Herein are two Things comprized, the meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, procuring the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Covenant of Grace, and our performing the Condition, only we are to know how this Righteouſneſs may be underſtood in reſpect to God, as it is all one with his Grace, or with reſpect to us as its all one upon which this Grace is vouchſafed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> This <hi>Neonomian</hi> Cheat is always to be noted in the Point of Satisfaction, that all the Satisfaction they aſcribe to Chriſt is only in making pay unto God for a new Purchaſe, they will not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41447:113"/>have Chriſt to have paid any Arrears or old Scores, the Law paſſeth away <hi>in ſententiam,</hi> and we found inſolvent to this perfect Law, therefore Chriſt buys another Law, upon that promiſeth Juſtification upon eaſier Terms, not ſo Holy, but ſinful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral, and therefore called the Law of Indulgence, yet juſtifies us upon thoſe Terms, but yet without Pardon which we muſt have of the Old Law, and becauſe we have fulfilled the New Law, God out of his Prerogative without any other Satisfaction than the forementioned procurement Pardons, for they ſay Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Pardon are inconſiſtent as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, and why do they ſay Chriſts Satisfaction is not imputed to us, becauſe if they were not aſhamed to ſpeak out they think there is none, yea and that they ſpeak of is only Chriſts purchaſing a new Law, which would be madneſs for to claim an Imputation of to us, for that concerns us no further then a new Legal Bondage, if Chriſts Righteouſneſs be not accepted for our Juſtification from the Old Law, and imputable to us, its not deſirable to be imputed to us to bring us under a new Law and further Bondage. Beſides, if Chriſt purchaſed this Law-making Power, its for himſelf, and not for us, for they will tell you he did not Purchaſe the Performance of the Condition, and when they ſay, we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our Works for the ſake of Chriſts Merits, their meaning is, becauſe Chriſt purchaſed the Law and Promulgation of it, juſt as if they ſhould ſay, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, he had been juſtified by his Works for the ſake of God who made the Law, for if there had been no Law there had been no Juſtification by it; ſo we are juſtified ſay they by the Law of Grace, for the ſake of Chriſt who merited the Law and became Law-maker; this is all they mean, and this is the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Cheat in the great Point of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, whereby they would by retaining the Word, only without the Sence, cover themſelves from the odious Name of <hi>Socinians.</hi> Laſtly, He makes Grace and Juſtice in reſpect of God to be all one, ſo that to be juſtified by Works of our own, and by Grace is all one, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles are all Non-ſenſe.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41447:114"/>Righteouſneſs of Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> had being uncircumciſed, that the ſame righteouſneſs may be imputed to them; and what righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is that? it is that through which iniquity is forgiven, and Sin covered, that it might not be imputed, and this is the righteouſneſs that's imputed without works. Hence I argue. That that righteouſneſs through which iniquity is forgiven, and ſin covered, and is imputed without works, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and not ours; but the righteouſneſs of Faith, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtle in that place, is ſuch, as appears, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 9, 10. Is there any iniquity forgiven in the New Law Righteouſneſs? no, they ſay, pardon is conſequent to it, its had of the old law: Is any Sin cover'd by it from the Eye of God's Juſtice? no, they ſay, God ſees their Sins by the old Law: Is righteouſneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted without works? no, it cannot be, becauſe its faith as a work is imputed, <hi>v.</hi> 13. The Promiſe <hi>that he ſhould be the heir of the world,</hi> was not through a law [then not through any works of a law] <hi>but through the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> therefore it was the the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; the righteouſneſs of a law is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therefore works; and its here alſo what the righteouſneſs of faith apprehends. That of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31. and <hi>chap.</hi> 10.6 we ſhall ſhew by and by was the righteouſneſs of Chriſt apprehended by faith: The Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. intends Chriſt's righteouſneſs; for what ſhould men do for the hope of that righteouſneſs which they have in themſelves; for <hi>by faith, all,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are one in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> true faith bringing forth love, as ſuch apprehends and waits for more and more comfort in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. That ſpoken of <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.7. is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt promiſed, <hi>the Seed of the Woman,</hi> that was the great Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the <hi>Antidiluvian</hi> Patriarchs, and by the Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Seed of the Woman promiſed, they believed he <hi>ſhould break the Serpents head; Noah</hi> became heir of this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which he received and lived comfortably in the enjoyment of, by faith in the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> brings for a further confirmation of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe places which ſpeak of the righteouſneſs of God, which they bring as a great Block in their way, and therefore take much pains to remove it: Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith, <hi>this Phraſe hath been much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken by many, who have been led into error thereby,</hi> and therefore he will endeavour to give the true ſence of it; to this purpoſe alſo Mr. <hi>H.</hi> we will therefore very diligently mark what they ſay.

We ſay, by the righteouſneſs of God is meant the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but theſe men ſay, its our own inherent righteouſneſs.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:41447:114"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That our righteouſneſs is called Gods in oppoſition meerly to that of works; let a man do what he can by his own ſtrength, or by God's aid he can never come to the law of works or</hi> Moſes; <hi>God hath therefore been pleaſed to make us a new law, a law of faith, or grace, or new covenant, having lower terms, in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereof the ſinner, in reſpect of the law, may be righteous, its a righteouſneſs performed by Grace, which God mercifully condeſcends to accept inſtead of that which is perfect, through the merits of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and in regard of that acceptation</hi> (N. B.) <hi>or this good will its called his, or the righteouſneſs which is of him.</hi> Lo here is the true Key which opens the Mind of the Apoſtle, therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> takes it to be the new-law-righteouſneſs which in theſe places is called the righteouſneſs of God, becouſe oppoſed to the old-law-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, becauſe alſo wrought of God.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s reſolution is in a manner the ſame, <hi>That the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect new-law-righteouſneſs is the righteouſneſs of God becauſe it is of his Inſtitution; as for perfect obedience to the law, (which is legal righteouſneſs) that is righteouſneſs in the ſtricteſt ſence, and in ſtrict juſtice can be taken for no other, and therefore the reward muſt be debt: But that an imperfect work, ſuch as Faith and Obedience ſhould be accounted righteouſneſs, muſt ariſe from the gracious Appointment, Deſignation and Ordination of God, who hath ſet up this Way and Method of becoming righteous under the Goſpel; and hence its ſaid, reckoned, accounted, imputed for righteouſneſs, which Phraſe imports Grace and Favour, as ſome note.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s. reaſons for his Opinion, are 1. <hi>Becauſe the Phraſe of ſubmitting to the righteouſneſs</hi> (Rom. 10.3.) <hi>of God ſeems to import, that this is a new law, inſtitution or way naturally we are not acquainted with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The Text runs quite againſt him, <hi>being ignorant of the righteouſneſs of God;</hi> how doth that appear? <hi>ſeeking to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, they ſubmitted not to</hi> [yielded not to accept of] <hi>the righteouſneſs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. God's righteouſneſs and man's are here directly oppoſed to each others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is directly againſt Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s reaſon, in that man need not be taught to ſet up his own righteouſneſs, they naturally adhere to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They did ſo cloſely adhere to it that they would not ſubmit to the Doctrine of Juſtification by the righteouſneſs of another, <hi>viz. the righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> ſee how the words will run in Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s. ſence, <hi>being ignorant of an imperfect righteouſneſs of their own performing, going about to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own performing, they ſubmitted not to a righteouſneſs of their own perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41447:115"/>which is Gods righteouſneſs;</hi> beſides, its not ſence to ſay, a man ſubmits or not to that which is his own righteouſneſs, but it is to ſay, he ſubmits to take the righteouſneſs of another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As the righteouſneſs of the law is that which the law requires,</hi> Rom. 2.26. <hi>ſo this righteouſneſs of God is that which God requires under the Goſpel.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. The righteouſneſs both under the Law and Goſpel is the righteouſneſs of God; what the law requires, God by the law requires, and indeed God requires but one righteouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law and Goſpel, and there's the righteouſneſs of the law, and the ſtricteſt righteouſneſs; and if there muſt be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the righteouſneſs of the Law and Goſpel, as our <hi>Neonomians</hi> make, its moſt proper to call the perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law, God's righteouſneſs, it being his more than an imperfect, ſinful righteouſneſs, which would be very diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him to be called his; But Chriſt's righteouſneſs is Legal, in that it anſwers the Law and Goſpel unto the Sinner, becauſe it anſwers it for him, and his peace with God is made thereby.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>As the Sacrament of the Supper is called the Lord's Supper, becauſe its his Inſtitution, and the Lord's Day becauſe his Deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Supper is not called <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> only becauſe its his Inſtitution, but becauſe our Lord's Body and Blood is ſhewed forth therein to be the righteouſneſs of God for our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Neither is the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> ſo called from his Deſign of it, but becauſe it is to remember the reſurrection of our Lord, <hi>who roſe for our Juſtification,</hi> having accompliſhed juſtifying righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for us. 4. Its oppoſed to their own righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. therefore not any righteouſneſs of their own, as is already ſhewed, <hi>ſupra,</hi> from Rom. 10.3.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Next let us ſee how Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> will prove that its not the righteouſneſs of Chriſt that's meant by the righteouſneſs of God in the aforeſaid places; he ſaith it cannot be for theſe reaſons, <hi>p.</hi> 33. 1. <hi>Becauſe the Apoſtle here diſtinguiſheth,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Chriſt, the righteouſneſs of God is one thing, and being in Chriſt another; whereas, if they were all one, the ſence would be, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of Chriſt in Chriſt: And</hi> p. 65. <hi>The Apoſtle alſo, in moſt places where he mentions it, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth between God and Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3.22.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> This Reaſon is ſo frivolous, that it needs little anſwer, There is no diſtinction at all in reſpect of righteouſneſs, but an exact account thereof, that the righteouſneſs of God, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Chriſt, that which is in Chriſt, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in Chriſt is that which is imputed to us; we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41447:115"/>need not look far to the meaning of the Apoſtle in the Phraſe, its but in <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing unto them their treſpaſſes, i. e.</hi> in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt God was working out reconciliation, and non-imputation of ſin, and if ſo, imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and he ſaith, if the righteouſneſs were one, its that they might be made the righteouſneſs of Chriſt in Chriſt; but I pray, why may not Chriſts righteouſneſs be called the righteouſneſs of God, as well as our own, becauſe they ſay, our own was God's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Is it ours, God's and ours too? and Chriſts righteouſneſs may not be God's and Chriſt's too; but this reaſoning is very abſurd, more of this as we proceed; and as for the other places, we ſhall come to them by and by.</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>P.</hi> 65. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. He always calls it, <hi>the righteouſneſs of God, and never the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it was the righteouſneſs of the Perſon who is God, and <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.

Why may not Chriſt's righteouſneſs be called the righteouſneſs of God for the ſame reaſon that you ſay our righteouſneſs is ſo called, becauſe it is the way and method through which he hath deſigned to juſtifie us, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he is the way,</hi> and if ſo, then the inſtituted and ordained way; now if this interpretation of the Text will ſerve for them, why not for us? I am ſure the righteouſneſs we plead for is the moſt deſerving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. He calls it, <hi>The righteouſneſs which is of God, not which is in God or Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> According to Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> its not the Attribute of Gods righteouſneſs, but its the work of righteouſneſs wrought by Go'd in the Perſon of his Son, therefore its propereſt to expreſs it as the Apoſtle, <hi>of God,</hi> and its often enough ſaid <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> therefore its not true. I find not any thing ſaid further, by either of them, to ſupport this Notion. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> talks here and there, in divers places about it, but the ſubſtance of all is put together more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically by Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and with more modeſty.</p>
               <p>§. 9. It remains now, that we take the ſaid Texts into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Conſideration, and examine what righteouſneſs is by them intended, which is called <hi>the righteouſneſs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. The Subject the Apoſtle treats of is, the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41447:116"/>Goſpel of Chriſt, the glad tidings brought to Sinners of Life and Salvation in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This he gives an account of as the reaſon why he is far from being aſhamed of it, in receiving it for its appointed Ends, for his own Salvation, or in preaching it for thoſe ends unto others. 1. Becauſe it is the power of God to Salvation of every one that believes, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 2. In this is the power of God in effectual Grace ſeen, in that its the Doctrine of Righteouſneſs. 3. He ſhews its the Doctrine of righteouſneſs by two things. 1. In that this righteouſneſs of God is revealed in it. 2. In that its the object of a Believer's Faith from time to time, its revealed to his firſt faith, and always of faith juſtifying afterwards, he lives upon this righteouſneſs from time to time, as he proves from the Prophet, <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> Now then its called the righteouſneſs of God. 1. Becauſe its a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs provided by God before the foundation of the World in his wiſe Counſels, and Covenant-Compact with the Son, as the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Chriſt as redeemer by his precious bloud, as of a lamb without ſpot</hi> [this is his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs] <hi>who verily [i. e.</hi> really as ſuch] <hi>was fore-ordained of God before the foundation of the world:</hi> It was then the Plot and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of God, and therefore may well be called, <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</hi> This Purpoſe and Grace to poor Sinners was firſt given us in the Perſon and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt before the World began, but was manifeſted ſince, and eſpecially at the firſt appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh, actually to work out this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in aboliſhing Death, and bringing Life and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Light in the ſaid Goſpel of Chriſt, which he was a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of; this Head I might be large in inſiſting on, from other places, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8 30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.8, 9. 2. It is the Righteouſneſs of the Perſon who is God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 3. Its the only righteouſneſs that God is well pleaſed with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for, and in which he makes his law honourable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4.

               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:41447:116"/>
               <p n="5">5. Its the Righteouſneſs of God, in regard of the ſtatelineſs and highneſs thereof, as the Trees of <hi>Lebanon</hi> were called the Trees of <hi>Jehovah, Pſal.</hi> 104.16.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In a way of oppoſition to all mens inherent righteouſneſs, which is humane, mans righteouſneſs only; this is God's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and <hi>be hath made Chriſt to be righteouſneſs to us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Now here is reaſon enough why Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be called the <hi>righteouſneſs of God,</hi> and that its plainly ſo intended in the Text appears.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe its a revealed righteouſneſs that Man ſaw not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they can eaſily ſee their own own righteouſneſs, without Revelation they are addicted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its the righteouſneſs of Chriſt that is the righteouſneſs of the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Goſpel of Chriſt is called ſo, becauſe its the <hi>preaching Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and becauſe its his Goſpel whereby he cometh and preacheth peace through his righteouſneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, becauſe its the great object of Faith in Juſtification; for its abſurd to ſay, our faith is the object of faith, its ſomething without a man firſt, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves upon; faith is the evidence or Hypoſtacy of things not ſeen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Its oppoſed to the Anger and Wrath of God revealed in the Law, <hi>v.</hi> 18. as that righteouſneſs which anſwers it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Apoſtle throughout this Epiſtle caſts off, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons all righteouſneſs of ours as inſufficient, therefore this muſt be the righteouſneſs intended.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Text is plain, that the righteouſneſs of God is ſpoken of objectively, as to faith; for a thing is revealed that it may be ſeen, its revealed from one act of faith to another, and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the words of the Prophet, <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> on this righteouſneſs believing in it, and feeding upon it as their food of life, and therefore is not in themſelves, but in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there as revealed; for the import of the words ſhould be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe men, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, it is the power of God to Salvation, for therein [i. e.</hi> in the Goſpel preached, not in our ſelves] <hi>is the righteouſneſs of God revealed,</hi> from one act of faith to another, to be ſeen by it [it is not ſaid that faith is revealed to be the righteouſneſs of God, but the righteouſneſs of God in the Goſpel,] becauſe it is <hi>the power of God to Salvation,</hi> is revealed to our faith, and to be that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is Goſpel righteouſneſs, therefore not in our ſelves. 3. The preaching thereof, is the power of God to Salvation, and that which a believers faith lives upon.</p>

               <p>§. 11. The next place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. The Apoſtle in the 9th <hi>verſe</hi> ſaith, he proved both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> under ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> under the tranſgreſſion of the Moral Law, as plainly appears by his Proof unto <hi>v.</hi> 19. now ſaith he, they are under the law in that they are convict by the law, even the whole World, by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> that law, not the Ceremonial but Moral, againſt which all the forementioned tranſgreſſions are committed, and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were never under the Ceremonial Law, as well as <hi>Jews.</hi> Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, ſeeing that by this Moral Law the World is condemned, its impoſſible that any works of obedience to any law whatever ſhould; for if any other law comes to milder terms, unleſs this law be reſcinded, its impoſſible any man can be righteous before God, hence he concludes, <hi>therefore by the deeds of the law,</hi> i. e. any law, <hi>no fleſh can be juſtified in Gods ſight;</hi> whatever Law men may pretend to, God will judge and try all by the Moral Law, for a ſinner and tranſgreſſor of God's law, can have the knowledge of ſin by it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Conviction but no Salvation by any righteouſneſs of his performance: What then, muſt all the World periſh therefore for want of a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

               </p>
               <p>§. 12. Now it appears that the righteouſneſs of God is Chriſt's righteouſneſs: That righteouſneſs that fully and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly ſatisfied that law which convicted all the world as guilty, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; but ſuch is the righteouſneſs here ſpoken of, as is apparent by the whole Text. 2. That righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we have by faith in another to juſtification, is the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41447:117"/>righteouſneſs of Chriſt; but this righteouſneſs is that which we have by and in another; for faith is ſaid to act upon what is without us, and not on that which is within us. 3. That which is imputed to Sinners, devoid of any righteouſneſs by the law, or by any law, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; but this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is ſo, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Propoſitions of theſe Syllogiſms lies plainly proved in the Text. 4. If all righteouſneſs be here pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily rejected, which is performed by us in obedience to any law, then the righteouſneſs here introduced, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, is Chriſt's righteouſneſs; but the Antecedent is true, <hi>v.</hi> 20. 5. If the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is our juſtifying righteouſneſs, which the Apoſtle intends throughout this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, then God's righteouſneſs is Chriſt's, but <hi>ergo,</hi> the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> which is the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> is proved. <hi>The redemption and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation of Chriſt is the righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified, v.</hi> 24.6. That righteouſneſs which the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> witneſſeth to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon and ſign thereof, is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as ſuch: For what did the ſacrifices for ſin, but witneſs to Chriſt's great propitiatory ſacrifice? but the ſacrifices of the law all held forth, <hi>Chriſt offering himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, and the Goſpel was therein preached.</hi> Now it's plain the Apoſtle brings in the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> witneſſing to this righteouſneſs of God.</p>
               <p>§. 13. The next place is <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. The <hi>Jews</hi> had a zeal for God, and a blind devotion, but were extreme ignorant of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Myſteries, being <hi>ignorant of the righteouſneſs of God, being ignorant of God' righteouſneſs in the law, viz.</hi> the perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>and going about to eſtabliſh their own imperfect righteouſneſs</hi> unto juſtification, they ſubmitted not to juſtification by <hi>God's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, being ignorant of Chriſt's righteouſneſs;</hi> for it's expreſly ſaid to be <hi>the righteouſneſs of God, v.</hi> 4. <hi>Submitted not to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God; for Chriſt is the end of the law, for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> Take the Argument then, that <hi>Chriſt's righteouſneſs is God's:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That righteouſneſs which is directly oppoſed to our own in juſtification, is Chriſt's righteouſneſs; but God's righteouſneſs here is ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That righteouſneſs which a man being ignorant of, tho' he know his own righteouſneſs, falls ſhort of juſtification, is Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> but the righteouſneſs of God in the Text is ſuch; <hi>ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That which is the <hi>end of the law for righteouſneſs, [i.e.</hi> anſwers the law] is the righteouſneſs of God; but <hi>Chriſt is the end of the law.</hi> This Argument is ſo plain and fall in the Text, that it cannot be anſwered with any fair pretence, tho' they make a blundering at it to no purpoſe; and you ſhall ſee the Apoſtle
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41447:118"/>oppoſeth it, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>to the righteouſneſs of the law, conſiſting in doing;</hi> and at once tells us, <hi>the righteouſneſs of God, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs of Faith, is but one righteouſneſs, and oppoſed to the righteouſneſs of the law which the Jews eſtabliſhed;</hi> thinking, as our <hi>Neonomians</hi> do, that it was ſufficient to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have ſome imperfect ſincere obedience to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s law, (For <hi>I bear them record,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they have a zeal of God,</hi> that's their ſincerity) which was the new law; for if they were ſaved by the law of Grace, this was diſpenſed to them in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s law; they knew not that God's law required perfect right, and its perfect right muſt anſwer it. Hence it appears that they had the ſame opinion that the <hi>Neonomians</hi> now have, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s law, was a new law, requiring only obedience to the moral part of it, ſo far as they could, and for their ſins to offer ſacrifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ceremonial part; and reſting therein, without faith in the Antitype, they reckoned themſelves fully righteous for juſtification: Hence, upon the annual day of atonement, they reckoned themſelves as innocent as <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, <hi>i. e.</hi> as free from guilt, propitiation being made, till they had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted more guilt: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>That the law being a ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> could never with thoſe ſacrifices, which they offered year by year, make the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers thereto perfect; and the moſt carnal of them reckoned themſelves perfected by thoſe ſacrifices but for a time. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's moſt abſurd, to aſſert, that the carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> whom the Apoſtle writes againſt, did endeavour after a perfection of the law of works; 1. Becauſe they offered ſacrifices, and made atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin. 2. Becauſe, when they did make atonement, they reckoned they contracted new guilt, and were perfect but for a time: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30, 31, 32. <hi>they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not to the righteouſneſs of faith, becauſe they ſought their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as it were by the works of the law,</hi> not directly by perfect obedience, but by ſuch as they had, and not by faith in Chriſt's obedience, for the Apoſtle is expreſs in it, <hi>for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone, which was Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle proves, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone,</hi> &amp;c. 3.

               <p>§. 14. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives his Explication of this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. thus, <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs,</hi> i. e. <hi>as I conſtrue it, Chriſt by his ſatisfaction, hath procured that we ſhould not he judged by the law of works, and conſequently, that righteouſneſs or juſtification be attained if we do perform the terms of the Goſpel.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Can Mr. <hi>H.</hi> be ſo irrational, as to think in his Judgment and Conſcience, that this is a genuine Interpretation- Here lies
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41447:118"/>in the Text very fairly theſe two things, 1. That the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God is explained by him particularly to be the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt— <hi>have not ſubmitted to, i. e.</hi> accepted the righteouſneſs of God: What is that? the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for Chriſt is the righteouſneſs that anſwers the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the law, and this is the righteouſneſs of God. 2. The Deſign and great End of the Law was righteouſneſs, and perfect righteouſneſs, unto Juſtification of Man, perfect cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by fallen man, therefore God hath provided a perfect righteouſneſs in Chriſt and <hi>he is</hi> this <hi>end of the law to every one that believeth,</hi> and herein, by juſtifying him by this righteouſneſs, <hi>God is juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus;</hi> and its the righteouſneſs of faith, becauſe its not for Juſtification by any thing that evacuates or relaxeth the law of God, but eſtabliſheth it in ſeeking for, and laying hold upon Juſtification by a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that fully anſwers the law. How will it hold in Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. ſence, That Chriſt by his Satisfaction hath procured, that we ſhould not anſwer the law of works, or that he ſhould not be the end of the law of works for righteouſneſs to a Believer; but that a believer's performance of obedience to the new law, ſhould be the end of the law of works, for righteouſneſs, which is a direct contradiction to the Text. For he faith, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the law,</hi> what law? of all law, of works, in way of Satisfaction of the Moral and concurring Ceremonial as an Antitype; he and his righteouſneſs is ſhadowed forth thereby; he ſaith not that Chriſt is the end of a law for a righteouſneſs of our performing, for that would be a contradiction; to fay the end of a law is righteouſneſs, and then Chriſt is the end of it for another righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and not his own; he ſhould have ſaid, believing is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. Laſtly, What righteouſneſs is it to take us from under a law, or relax it, or procure that it ſhall not be ſatisfied at all, and that the offender ſhall be juſtified by another Law?</p>
               <p>§. 15. The next Text is, <hi>He hath made him ſin for us who knew no ſin that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>H. the immaculate lamb made a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our ſins, that we may become righteous with the righteouſneſs of God, which he accepts through him; Chriſt as a Sacrifice redeems us from a Law of Sin, and purchaſeth for us a law of grace, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that law we have a righteouſneſs which is a righteouſneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted unto life through Chriſt.</hi> Medioc. p. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> So that Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. meaning muſt be, That Chriſt was made Sin under the old law, that we might have righteouſneſs by him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new law, and that what Chriſt did under the old law,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41447:119"/>amounted to no righteouſneſs to us; But he muſt be righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us under the New Law, and then Chriſt was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Law, which theſe men will deny, and be our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs there; no, ſay they, not himſelf be our righteouſneſs, but procure that we ſhould be our own righteouſneſs; then the true meaning is here, That Chriſt was made Sin for us— that we ſhould be our own righteouſneſs; but how our righteouſneſs in Chriſts? is our righteouſneſs Chriſts? then it is that we may be made Chriſts righteouſneſs, becoming ours by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Chriſt <hi>being made ſin for us,</hi> he gloſſes upon as the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, i. e. Chriſt the immaculate Lamb was made a ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> It is true, Chriſt is expreſly ſaid to be a ſacrifice for ſin, but how? 1. As the true Sacrifice, not as a typical, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. 2. As a Sacrifice to bear Sin; not leſs, but more than all the Sacrifices of Old, and therefore it is ſaid <hi>to be made ſin for us;</hi> he was not a ſinner by nature, neither was his nature corrupted by his being made Sin for us, therefore he was made ſin by legal imputation; <hi>made ſin,</hi> becauſe put under the law, the Prieſts and Sacrifices of old had the ſins of the People laid upon them, ſin was charged on them, their own firſt for which they ſacrificed, then the ſins of the People; but Chriſt did not only bear Sin as the Sacrifice that was ſlain, but as Scape Goat alſo, for one Type could not hold forth the fulneſs of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, he did not only bear ſin, but bore it away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26, 28. Now its a ſtrange thing that theſe men ſhould ſpit at this Doctrine of Chriſt's bearing Sin, one of late calling it Poyſon; another ſaying, he bore not our very ſins, and all, that he bore only ſuffering for ſin; I would know, how any can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for Sin. in Law or Juſtice, and not legally bear the charge of ſin? And how Chriſt came to be a Curſe, if he bore not Sin?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He bore Sin becauſe he bore the Curſe of the Law, <hi>he was made a curſe,</hi> doth curſe come upon any but for ſin?

                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> The Words are not, Chriſt is Wiſe and Holy in our ſtead, but that Chriſt is made of God to us what he is there ſaid to be, whether Wiſdom as a Prophet to teach us, or Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a Prieſt, to Cloath us with the Garment of Salvation and Robe of Righteouſneſs; and that he is made of God to be what he is in the divers Ways and manner of Being or Conveying, what we have from him, he is our Wiſdom by way of teaching, Righteouſneſs by way of Sacrifice, Sanctification by being the Treaſure of all Grace and Holineſs which God beſtows, he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in that all the Promiſes of Inchoation and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Redemption are yea and <hi>Amen in him.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> makes Righteouſneſs and Sanctification all one, and Chriſt being to us all theſe Things one way by meriting and procuring, we have as much right to ſay too, that Chriſt is all theſe one Way, <hi>viz.</hi> by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, becauſe we are ſure he is Righteouſneſs to us by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but why is Active annexed to Righteouſneſs, he might have excluded his whole Righteouſneſs by what follows, both Active and Paſſive intentionally. But is not Chriſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in our ſtead, when he ſatisfied Gods Law and Juſtice in our ſtead? For what? For any wrong we had done unto the Law of God; I pray, is not that our Righteouſneſs which is Righteouſneſs in our ſtead; but theſe Men will have Satisfaction, and no Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, only a new Bargain or Purchaſe; likewiſe a Satisfaction, but not for us, ſo their Satisfaction which they will have Chriſt make is no Payment for us nor accounted ſo by God, nor any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to him for any wrong we have done him, that which Chriſt hath done is a Purchaſe of a Righteouſneſs; he ſaith, we ſay Righteouſneſs is the Purchaſe Money, accounted to us; ſo that Chriſt is not only a Procurer and Beſtower, but he hath
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41447:123"/>ſomething to procure and Purchaſe by, he hath ſomething to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, now as God hath made Chriſt, the ſatisfying Price and Ranſom-mony, ſo he is made of God Righteouſneſs to us; but with Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> Righteouſneſs and Sanctification is all one, this is hard dealing with <hi>Jehovah</hi> our Righteouſneſs, theſe Men are as the <hi>Jews</hi> of Old, that would not be ſubject to the Righteouſneſs of God.</p>
               <p>§. 5.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> This plain Place which ſtands a Rock againſt all <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Neonomian</hi> Attempts, he calls preſt into our Service, or Cauſe; no it comes in freely, it's a Volunteer, and mighty thro' God to caſt down all their Confidence and Imaginations, where's the clearneſs in all this Chapter, or <hi>Pſalm</hi> from whence its ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? is it not clear for the Imputation of anothers Righteouſneſs? Is there any thing of ſelf-righteouſneſs? Faith is ſpoken of as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs, but we have ſhewn that, that which was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs, was the Righteouſneſs of the promiſed Seed; for the Goſpel, which is the Doctrine of Chriſts Righteouſneſs was Preached to him in the Promiſe, and he by Faith ſaw Chriſt's Day of Expiation and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, this he reached by Faith, and it was imputed to him not Faith it ſelf, not the Arm that reached it, but the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs it ſelf. There's a Plain Inſtance in the Goſpel, where what the Object of Faith doth, is aſcrib'd by a Metonymy to Faith it ſelf, <hi>Mat</hi> 9.21, 22. The diſeaſed Woman touched the Hem of Chriſt's Garment, and was made whole, and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thy Faith hath made thee whole.</hi> And we ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 9.29, 30. where is the ſame Narrative, that Chriſt perceived that Vertue was gone out of him, and yet ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Thy Faith hath made thee whole;</hi> now I would know of theſe Men, whether it was Chriſt's Vertue that healed the Woman, or the Vertue of her Faith, Faith as an Act of hers that made her whole? See <hi>Luke</hi> 7.39, 42, 47, 48, 50. Likewiſe the ſtung <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were healed by looking on the Brazen Serpent, was the healing Vertue in the Brazen Serpent, or in their own Eyes. Let us now examine then how clear it is, that the Place is not meant of the Righteouſneſs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41447:123"/>of another. The Apoſtle ſaith, that David <hi>deſcribeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the man to whom the Lord imputeth righteouſneſs without works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtles deſign in the whole <hi>Chapter</hi> is to prove our Juſtification by a righteouſneſs which is not made up of works of our own, and the <hi>Neonomians</hi> ſay, his deſign is to prove, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by works, are not theſe <hi>contradicentia?</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>negat ubique,</hi> they ſay, by ſome works only, the Apoſtle means works of the old law, they the works of the new; Its ſtrange the Apoſtle did not except and ſecure works of the new law; but I ſuppoſe, as for the works of the new law he never heard of them, thence his <hi>altum ſilentium</hi> about the new law and its works too. He ſaith <hi>David</hi> was juſtified, or Juſtification was with a righteouſneſs without works, and yet <hi>David</hi> might plead his own works to Juſtification, as well as any <hi>Neonomian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He was no carnal <hi>Jew</hi> that ſought Juſtification by the law of Works, as appears by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there was any Juſtification then by New-Law works (as indeed there was not then or now) <hi>David</hi> ſure muſt be under the New Law for Juſtification, and he muſt needs know the works thereof, whereby he expected to be juſtified; and therefore I thus argue, <hi>If</hi> David <hi>knew he was juſtified by works, and bleſſed therein, then he deals falſly, or the Apoſtle greatly miſtakes him, in ſaying that</hi> David <hi>proves the bleſſedneſs of the man,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> is of abſolute neceſſity, and the <hi>aſſumption</hi> muſt, <hi>tollere ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. ut tollat conſeq.</hi> for they were both inſpired, and therefore could not deceive themſelves nor us in this great Point.</p>
               <p>Arg. <hi>If</hi> David <hi>proves a righteouſneſs without his own works, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old or new-law works, then it muſt be works of another that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, for there's no righteouſneſs without works of ſome or another; if he plainly mean the excluſion of his own works, then he muſt mean ſome righteouſneſs of another, and not his own, as appears by this</hi> Pſal. 31. and alſo 51. Now we ſhall prove that <hi>David</hi> means the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and not of the New Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That righteouſneſs by which ſin is forgiven is not New-Law righteouſneſs, but Chriſt's, and without our works, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is ſuch here.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is proved from the <hi>Neonomians</hi> themſelves, who ſay, there's no forgiveneſs in Juſtification by Works, but forgiveneſs is conſequent of it, for that they go to the old Law Bar, that the righteouſneſs whereby ſin is forgiven is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, becauſe its expreſſed by <hi>blood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is not without blood,</hi> and forgiveneſs being one Medium by which the Apoſtle proves Juſtification without works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That righteouſneſs which covers from the eye of God's Juſtice in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41447:124"/>the law, is a righteouſneſs without our works, and anothers, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Now as to the <hi>major</hi> it appears by the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Doctrine, that their righteouſneſs in Juſtification doth not cover ſin; for they ſay, its a ſinful righteouſneſs, and needs pardon, therefore their righteouſneſs cannot cover ſin, which is ſinful in it ſelf, and there can be no righteouſneſs but Chriſt's that can cover ſin; Mens own righteouſneſſes are far from being ſuch covering.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That righteouſneſs through which God imputeth not ſin to any chargeable therewith is a righteouſneſs of another, but this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without works is ſuch, Ergo.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is plain by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, for what the Apoſtle rehearſeth from the Prophet, is <hi>David</hi>'s deſcription <hi>of this righteouſneſs without works.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is clear from what went before, no man hath righteouſneſs enough to cover his own ſin. Neither can God not impute ſin where he ſees ſin to be more than righteouſneſs, God muſt impute Sin where Sin is ſeen uncovered by righteouſneſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be a righteouſneſs through which God imputeth not ſin, its certain its not ours, but Chriſt's only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Righteouſneſs through which God imputeth not Sin is juſtifying Righteouſneſs, and Chriſts alone, but the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch a Righteouſneſs. Now the <hi>major</hi> is plain, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is that through which God imputes not ſin, for he ſaith, <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes.</hi>

                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Theſe men will hold their Concluſion, let the Scripture ſay what it will. Then the import of the Apoſtle muſt be thus, That I may be found in Chriſt not having mine own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is of the old law, but my righteouſneſs of the New Law through faith, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</p>
               <p>Paul's <hi>righteouſneſs as a Jew and Phariſee was one thing, and</hi> Paul's <hi>Faith and Obedience, which is his righteouſneſs as a Chriſtian, is another.</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. That <hi>Paul</hi>'s righteouſneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Converſion is here directly oppoſed to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for he would not be found in his own, but this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, to be found in it, <hi>i. e.</hi> by judicial Enquiry, his own righteouſneſs can't be holineſs, or the having it, for he doth not, nor would ſay, he would not be found having of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There can be no Goſpel-righteouſneſs of our own that ſtands in competition with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for then its legal and fleſhly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man's own righteouſneſs, whether before or after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Converſion, is his own, of the ſame nature and kind, whatever he himſelf may think of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judgment that his works was only chang'd from one law to another, and thought that he was now to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by his Goſpel-Works, he was as far from the Kingdom of Heaven as before; for one law can no more juſtifie a man by his own works than another, therefore rejects all righteouſneſs of a law.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He is very full in expreſſing what righteouſneſs he would be found in, in no righteouſneſs of his own, for all ſuch is legal, in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>in him,</hi> this he tells us is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which faith lays hold on, and this is the righteouſneſs of God, which God imputes to Juſtification, and the ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by faith.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He intends not any thing here of Sanctification in this <hi>v.</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:41447:125"/>but ſpeaks ſingly and by it ſelf, of it in the next; neither doth he call it <hi>his righteouſneſs,</hi> but in this <hi>ver.</hi> ſets aſide all his works, tho he ſhews his value of them in their place, yet as for any place in Juſtification, he counted them but Droſs and Dung. He adds the Words of our Saviour, <hi>except your righteouſneſs exceeds the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> which is againſt him, for no mans righteouſneſs exceeds theirs, which ſtand in his own for Juſtification before God: It muſt not be our own that can, it muſt be Chriſts alone, for no other exceeds theirs.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> The next Text is, <hi>by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Rom. 5.19. Here Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> both exclude Chriſt's active obedience, as having nothing to do. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith, this is perfect <hi>Antinomian</hi> Faith, and excludes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance quite out of this life. I muſt tell him, I am ſorry he underſtands Repentance no better; thoſe that he calls <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> knows how to reconcile Chriſts Perfections and their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties together, I ſee, better than he doth, as if Chriſt being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Second <hi>Adam,</hi> did exclude Grace from us, where it is of his fulneſs for righteouſneſs and holineſs that we receive and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Grace, but ſo much only by the way, as a Mark upon the Dirt that he often throws on the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and Reformers, and upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; I muſt confeſs, that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him with more mildneſs than he deſerves. As to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the active obedience of Chriſt, there's no ground for it in the Text, but quite contrary; the deſign of the Apoſtle in the 2d part of the Chapter, from <hi>v.</hi> 12. is to ſhew how Sin and Death entered by the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and how Righteouſneſs and Life entered by the Second <hi>Adam.</hi> He accordingly compares them together as contraries, ſhews that the firſt was a Figure of the other, in his general nature, but after ſhews notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their agreement in a general nature, how greatly they differ ſpecifically, ſin entred into the World by the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his Sin and by Propagation; ſo Righteouſneſs by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and Life as the Promiſe annexed unto the Second <hi>Adam.</hi> The Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a Type or Figure of the Second.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the Firſt was a Publick Foederal and Seminal Head, to all his Poſterity, ſo the Second was to all his; and therefore upon the Fall of Man from the Perfection of the Law, the Second is made under the Law, and ſtands in all the Perfection of it, as a Publick Head to all his ſpiritual Seed: Now that Chriſt's active obedience is not excluded in the Text, appears by the plain <hi>Antitheſis</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, to the Second's obedience; for where diſobedience and obedience are ſet one againſt another, then as the one is actual ſin, ſo the other is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41447:126"/>obedience; for if only paſſive obedience be here meant, then it ſhould be ſaid, as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the Sufferings or Satisfactions of one many were made righteous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Firſt in the Figure was a Publick Perſon, in reſpect of his actual obedience or diſobedience to the Law of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Second <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be a Publick Perſon alſo in reſpect of his active obedience, or elſe he anſwers not to the Figure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt could not be without active obedience as the Head and Root of his Church, the Root muſt be actually holy, or elſe the Branches cannot be ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was eſſential to his High-Prieſthood to be <hi>holy, harmleſs, &amp;c.</hi> as ſuch, and a High Prieſt is a Publick Perſon, and ſtands for the People, I could be very large in proving that Chriſt's active obedience belongs to that righteouſneſs of Chriſt by which we are juſtified; but I ſhall not have room here. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> makes as if he would exclude Chriſt's active obedience only from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but it is the paſſive alſo which both he and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſtrikes at, for he ſaith, <hi>As by</hi> Adam's <hi>ſin all his poſterity were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtate of ſin, ſo that by the Merits of Chriſt's ſufferings they are brought into ſuch a ſtate as that they may be made righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp. i. e.</hi> They are brought into ſuch a capacity by Chriſt's purchaſing a new law, that they may poſſibly be righteous by their own righteouſneſs; So that <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin brought his into a ſtate of ſin, but Chriſt by his righteouſneſs doth procure a poſſibility of a righteouſneſs for his; ſo that the Second <hi>Adam</hi> comes ſhort of the Firſt in Conveiance, whereas the Apoſtle hath <hi>much more, Rom.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, hath abounded unto many,</hi> v. 15. <hi>So if by the offence of one, death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of Grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. Mr. <hi>Cl. Chriſt is called the Surety of a better Covenant</hi> Heb. 7.22. <hi>Whence ſome infer, that he hath paid the debt of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God for us; Interpreters generally aſſign two ways wherein Chriſt is a Surety,</hi> 1. <hi>By undertaking for God to us, or his becoming Security for God, that he ſhould make good his Covenant to us on his part.</hi> 2. <hi>By undertaking for us to God, that we ſhould perform the Condition of the Covenant, the firſt the</hi> Polonian <hi>Merchants,</hi> Grotius <hi>and</hi> Hammond <hi>are for; the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>generally ſtick to this latter, that Chriſt is our Surety, by undertaking for us to God; that we ſhall fulfil the Condition of the Covenant by yielding that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that is required of us therein.</hi>

                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> tells of the Merchants that they the <hi>Neonomians</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the Spirit of God hath uſed in the Old and New; which do expreſs ſingular Truths and Myſteries not common, I ſhall only Note ſome things generally that are Truths I will ſtand by, as 1. That Chriſt is not a Metaphorical Surety, but the moſt proper Surety that ever was, and the Exemplar of all Sureties. 2. That the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifies a Surety for Debt. 3. That is a Surety of the better Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, not that he was a Surety of the Performance of that Covenant, but that he is the Surety in that Covenant, that is bound to pay the Debt that we owe to the Juſtice of God in the Covenant of Works which we have broken; and he is not ſuch a Surety, as to be bound to the Juſtice of God, that we ſhould pay the Debt [the Lord have Mercy on <hi>Neonomians</hi>] but he hath undertaken to pay the whole Debt for us; every Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if he had been ſuch a Surety as Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſpeaks of; we were in a miſerable Condition. I know the <hi>Neonomians</hi> do moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline to be with their <hi>Polonian</hi> Merchants, in Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> firſt Point mentioned as to God's Suretiſhip to us, but it's no great Matter where they be, the ſecond Particular being worſe than the former; for Chriſt to be engaged to God, that we ſhall pay the Debt that we owe to the Law of God by <hi>Adams</hi> fall and our Sin; <hi>i. e.</hi> that we ſhall ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for the wrong done, and that we ſhall perform perfect Obedience to the Law; thus much Man muſt pay, tho a poor inſolvent wretched Creature, and Chriſt hath engaged to ſee it done, but not to pay any thing of the Debt himſelf: And indeed I can prove this to be the true Account of their Doctrine; for they ſay, Chriſt hath procured and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God a new Law, whereby the old Law is relaxed or repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (not paid or ſatisfied) a new one is ſet up, the Condition whereof we performing we ſhall be juſtified, but procured not, nor merited the Condition to be performed by us. Now I would fain know, whether Chriſt was a Surety for that which he never Purchaſed, is Chriſt a Surety, that we ſhall perform the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant, and never merited Faith and Obedience, what a kind of Surety will they have Chriſt, to engage for our Performance, and not take care that we ſhould have the <hi>cum quo?</hi> But Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſeems not to be quite ſatisfied with this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41447:127"/>Way. He adds a Third to mend the Matter a little, at leaſt to put a gloſs upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> 3. <hi>To diſcharge that Debt of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which we did owe the Law for the Tranſgreſſing of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Ay Sir, now you ſay ſomething, you bring a Surety with Mony in his Hands, we uſe indeed to ſay, that a Man ſhould never be bound for another, unleſs he reſolve to pay the Debt; Chriſt knew well enough how Poor we ſhould be, when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this Suretiſhip: Well, let us ſee whether Chriſt clears the ſcore for us, or whether he doth leave a conſiderable part of the Debt for us to pay our ſelves: It may be, that which the Law is primarily and moſtly concern'd at, and that for a wiſe <hi>Neonomian</hi> End, <hi>viz.</hi> That if he ſhould pay all, the Sinner would prove an Idle <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and Shabby-fellow, having nothing to do himſelf, and nothing to pay; therefore Chriſt indeed paies ſome of the Debt, but laies up the Sinner in a Work-houſe to pay the reſt at his Fingers ends; For ſaith Mr. <hi>Cl. Now take it in which of theſe Three Ways you will, yet there's nothing of his paying the Debt of Active Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> A very ſad Story indeed, a great noiſe of a Surety, that would pay the whole Debt of the poor Man in Priſon, and when the Matter is ſtrictly enquired into, he hath only prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſhould not be whipt ſo often in <hi>Bridewel,</hi> though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that he ſhould have the Laſh too pretty ſeverely ſometimes; but as for the greateſt Part of the Debt he muſt Work it out, at leaſt ſo far as a new Law of his which he hath procured and made doth require. Well, when all comes to all, here's nothing done to free the Sinner, but he muſt pay all the good Money by the Sweat of his Brows, for Active Obedience to the Law is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that which the Law ſets a High value upon, being the firſt and main Thing that it deſigns and aims at; and it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not only to be ſatisfied for Diſobedience but muſt be obeyed, yea and it muſt be paied by perfect Obedience too not by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Now ſaith our <hi>Neonomian,</hi> Chriſt was no Surety to pay any of our Debt of Active Obedience; how then, hath he made no Proviſion in this Caſe? Yes truly, he hath done ſomething that may help a little, He hath taken down the old ſtrict Law that kept the Sinner at continual hard-work, and brought in a new ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie remedying Law, then he makes choice of his own Work and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and his own Time, and work at leiſure, only muſt have the Laſh now and then, and beſure that he Work when he is going to Die, and the Condition ſhall be performed and the Debt paid. Now I only briefly argue, if Chriſt was a Surety, it was to pay all our Debt in Active and Paſſive Obedience or none; for Chriſt paid not by halves, though the Paſſive Obedience is hardeſt, yet
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41447:127"/>the active is hardeſt to do, the damned can ſuffer, and ſhall, but can pay nothing of the debt by active obedience to the preceptive part of the Law. Well, Chriſt was a Surety to pay all our Debt by active and paſſive obedience, for elſe his righteouſneſs would be imperfect, the law left unſatisfied, and we moſt certain to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh that could never pay, there is no obedience of the Saints that ſatisfies the Law, Chriſt performed that as a Publick Perſon in their Stead, as well as he bore the paſſive too, whence the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Debt was full and compleat; but the <hi>Neonomians</hi> will have this part of active obedience left for us to pay, and our active obedience ſhall be imputed to us for righteouſneſs, though Chriſt's ſhall not: So to gather up theſe mens Suretiſhip of Chriſt it is thus, Chriſt in his tranſaction with the Father agrees with him, 1. That he would pay one half of the Debt, and we ſhould pay the other and the beſt half too. 2. That ſeeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we ſhould grow inſolvent as not to be able to make the payment of our part in currant Money according to the firſt Law, that he would purchaſe a new law, and not ſatisfie the old, but repeal it, and the new law ſhould make all our Braſs Money currant, and that God ſhould take that Money for our part, and for his accepting it he becomes Surety for God to us, and thus they come to agree with the <hi>Polonian</hi> Merchants.</p>
               <p>§. 9. The Word uſed <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22 is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> it ſignifieth, <hi>praes ſatisfactionibus obnoxius,</hi> one made liable to make ſatisfaction for another, and therefore <hi>ſponſor &amp; fide-juſſor; Praes</hi> we are told was an ancient Title of a Surety being one that anſwer'd the cauſe of the Commonwealth, to which he was bound, for any it had a complaint againſt, therefore he was asked by the Magiſtrate when he appeard, <hi>num praes ſit,</hi> he anſwered <hi>Praes ſum,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported two things, 1. That he appeared <hi>praes ſum quia prae ſum,</hi> i. e. <hi>coram, I appear before you.</hi> 2. That he appeared not for himſelf, but for another, in his place or room, as a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Repreſentative of the perſon or perſons for whom he appear'd; what he did he did in the perſon of him that was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by him, and ſo owns himſelf either <hi>fide-juſſor</hi> on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, or <hi>ſponſor,</hi> for that the perſon charged ſhould give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or he himſelf would do it; but when the perſon repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented is apparently inſolvent, and never likely to be otherwiſe, the <hi>Sponſor</hi>'s obligation is not upon conditional terms, if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal do not, but he becomes bound abſolutely to pay the whole Debt; Chriſt was thus an abſolute Surety for Man inſolvent to God in his Law and Juſtice, to pay the whole Debt due from Man to God: For it was clear to both the Father and the Son, that upon the foreſeen Fall Man would be an abſolute Bankrupt,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41447:128"/>and never able to pay a Farthing of the Debt; hence ſaith Dr. <hi>Gouge, Chriſt was a Surety to God for Man, of whom the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired two things,</hi> 1. <hi>Perfect obedience to the Laws Precepts.</hi> 2. <hi>Full ſatisfaction for ſin, both theſe Chriſt performed, Rom.</hi> 5.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. according to whoſe judgment we hold the Doctrine of the Suretiſhip of Chriſt. Then from what hath been ſaid, we may conclude. That the Suretiſhip of Chriſt doth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently belong to his Mediatorial Office, whereby he hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely engaged himſelf in the Covenant of Grace, to ſtand and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for, to anſwer for us, and ſatisfie all the Demands of Juſtice in the Law, according to the full, true and perfect tenor of it, on the behalf of all the Elect, and hath anſwered, ſatisfied, and doth appear for them accordingly. I ſhall ſpeak to this Deſcription particularly, in Brief. 1. This Suretiſhip eminently belongs to his Mediators Office, becauſe hereby he Mediates to make up the Difference between God and Man; and was called to it by his Father. 2. Becauſe it belongs to his Prieſtly Office, as the Text ſhews, in ſo much that his Father conſtituted him Surety, by that Oath whereby he made him Prieſt after the Order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck,</hi> ver. 20, 21. And by ſo much, he was a better Surety and Prieſt than any of Old, in that God never ſware that any of them ſhould be Prieſts for ever after the Order of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.</hi> 3. It eſſentially belongs to his Mediators Office in making Reconciliation, as might be amply ſhewn, if theſe and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be conſidered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. 2. In that he is a Surety of the better Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe its that better Teſtament that his Mediators Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, more eminently and fully, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace ſhines forth in, called the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. The fuller and clearer, and moſt laſting Revelation of Chriſt, where he is ſet as the only High prieſt over the Houſe of God, and the Surety thereof, here in better Teſtament or New Teſtament, is an expreſs Oppoſition to the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, which was the Exhibition of the Covenant of Grace more legally and vaild, and under temporal Promiſes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle calls faulty, compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. wherefore Chriſt is called the High-prieſt and Surety of this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Teſtament, the Covenant being therein more perſpicuous and manifeſt; wherein Chriſt hath his Conſtitution and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment as Surety to his Church. 3. He hath become Surety by Covenant engagement unto God, if thou ſhalt make thy Soul an Offering for Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lord I come to do thy Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all this is by way of Covenant-Agreement, freely engaging on both ſides; therefore he is Surety by this Covenant, and not for himſelf;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41447:128"/>but for Sinners, Debtors to Gods Law, therefore a Publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 4. He is to ſtand for others to repreſent them before God, for what Promiſes are made to him is to them in him; and its <hi>i. e.</hi> what he doth is for them, what he engageth to pay is in their Perſons and Room. 5. He promiſeth abſolutely to pay their Debts, and all the Debts and Demands of that Law both as to Active Obedience and Paſſive, both as to Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Debt of Obedience to the Preceptive Part of the Law, and the Debt of Puniſhment as to the vindictive Part of the Law, and in order thereto to write himſelf Debtor, to bear their Sins, and to be made Sin by Imputation, and this he doth not conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, if they don't Pay, but abſolutely knowing they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Pay, nor upon Terms of their performing the Condition of a New Law; but by abſolute Obligation to perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of this Law which they had offended and broke, and by bearing this Sin and Curſe of this Law, and reconciling them to God in reſpect of this Law, and that not by giving an equivalent but by paying the ſame, according to the true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tenor of the Law. 6. This Engagement he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to us in Time, but to God that dwells in Eternity, there's no Time, nor Succeſſion; Chriſt was ſet up from Eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. as Surety, a Thouſand Years are to God but as one Day, and much leſs, therefore Chriſts Execution of his Suretiſhip on Earth in the Days of his Fleſh was Eternally before the Lord; hence he is ſaid to be ſlain from the Foundation of the World; hence the faithful before his coming had a full <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In Anſwer to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I ſay, 1. Chriſt himſelf is the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs, its not procured, but its that which procures. 2. The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is here propheſied of, not the righteouſneſs of our ſelves. 3. Its the Righteouſneſs that expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the old tranſgreſſions, and therefore here is nothing of a New-Law ſpoken of. 4. Juſtifying righteouſneſs is ſuch as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies the Law broken, and therefore there muſt be at leaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation in it. 5. Its very abſurd, and <hi>contradictio in adjecto,</hi> to talk of a Law of Grace, if thereby be meant a law for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and again abſurder, to talk of performing the condition of a law without law. 6. How is new-law-righteouſneſs, for its but imperfect obedience, and therefore will be quite wipt away at death; for when things that are perfect are come, thoſe that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41447:130"/>are imperfect are done away; you will ſay, it may laſt in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs, than the New Law will turn into he old; for they make imperfection to be a proper adjunct of the works of the New-Law, and appropriate to it to diſtinguiſh it from the old law. So that here they are juſtified by the New Law, and in Heaven by the Old Law: What a ſtir do theſe men make with the Law? and how do they ſhift and ſhirk from one law to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſwerving from Faith and Truth, to laws ſingly, making themſelves great teachers of the laws, but underſtanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm, I would fain know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Daniel</hi> was juſtified by his own New Law righteouſneſs? it ſeems he did not underſtand that that kind of Juſtification was then a-foot, and its a Wonder the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> could come to tell him, that in a few years hence the Meſſias ſhould come and bring in old ſelf righteouſneſs again for Juſtification, which is ſo choice and precious a Commodity, that it ſhall coſt him his blood to purchaſe, Would not <hi>Daniel</hi> be amazed at it, that a man ſo beloved as he was, was ignorant of it, but that very day, as <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>According to thy righteouſneſs, I beſeech thee, let thy anger and thy fury be turned away;</hi> a <hi>Neonomian</hi> will Gloſs thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to our righteouſneſs of the New Law, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>We do not preſent our ſupplications to thee for our righteouſneſs</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſay the <hi>Neonomians,</hi> the righteouſneſs of the Old Law, not of the New] <hi>but for thy great mercy,</hi> that, ſay they, is the Law of Grace, ſo they will have their Belly-full of law ſhortly.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives a wild Gloſs upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in Chriſt. before the Foundation of the World; he ſaith, the Election of Grace is the Election of Grace, and Gods choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us, is the taking the Way and Method of Grace, and not of Works, a choice way of ſaving.</hi>

This is Grace without conditions (he ſaith) even as much as the firſt Covenant; for God made that Covenant without Man's cauſing it, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was <hi>lege conſtitura,</hi> in the law enacted, the previous cauſes of a law, whether it proceed from the meer pleaſure of the Legiſlator, or obtained from him by Petition or Purchace, are not conſidered in the law by the Subject, its the tenour of it that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41447:131"/>he looks at, and is concerned in it, therefore the making a law, the proper nature whereof is to be conditional, and promulgat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it to all the world, is no Pardon; therefore he ſoon trips up the heels of his General Pardon, in ſaying, <hi>If any come to look for benefit by this Pardon, Act of Grace, Law, Covenant, Teſtament,</hi> (any thing, <hi>a declaration of the will of God,</hi> as he ſaith, which being a law is not therefore Grace) he <hi>muſt read it, and ſee the conditions or terms that God requires.</hi> And are not theſe conditions required of all the World? are they therefore pardoned becauſe they are required of them? <hi>its required of every man</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>to believe, repent, walk ſincerely in order to the benefit,</hi> if theſe be the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Covenant, then not free, becauſe working conditions are required of all the World, which by the World are unperform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

               <p>§. 4. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> makes a long Diſcourſe to acquaint us, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> do both mean Juſtification by Faith to be Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Works; that <hi>Paul</hi> in denial of Juſtification by works only, means works of the law; then, I ſay, he excludes all works,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41447:131"/>for all works performed for Juſtification are works of the law, and to ſay that ſuch are Goſpel-works, is to ſay, the Sea burns. And that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Juſtification before God by Faith in conjunction with Works; That <hi>Paul</hi> makes a perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all works of any law from Juſtification, <hi>i e.</hi> works of our own performance hath been ſufficiently made to appear; what he alledgeth for <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning, <hi>p.</hi> 70. may be a little ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, <hi>and undertakes</hi> to tell us, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5, 6. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 6.15. that <hi>Paul</hi> intends <hi>works as well as faith when he rejects works from Juſtification:</hi> I muſt ſay as I have ſaid, If <hi>Paul</hi> was of their mind, it is ſtrange that in Two Epiſtles he had not acquainted us what he meant, when he ſhall only intend <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Services which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are not concerned in, and perfect works of the Moral Law, which none ever performed, ſince the Fall, but Chriſt alone, that he ſhould mean Goſpel-works, and not tell us, what were the Goſpel-works which he meant, when Goſpel-works whereby any man ſeeks Juſtification, are law-works, and therefore <hi>contradictio in adjecto.</hi> The Apoſtle to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, v.</hi> 4. makes a ſolemn Proteſtation, that <hi>whoever is [i. e.</hi> profeſſeth to be] <hi>juſtified by law</hi> [by his own works of a law] hath abdicated Chriſt, <hi>and fallen from Grace,</hi> where there cannot be a law of Grace; for to aſſert a law in our Juſtification by our performance of the works of it, is to fall from Grace; now it is ſtrange that he did not ſpecifie the Law and Works that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended we are juſtified by. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith he did, in his ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love and the New Creature. <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love;</hi> the Apoſtle had ſaid before, as for us our expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of righteouſneſs is only by faith, for its nothing that availeth at all in Chriſt but a true faith, and that is true which worketh by love, which bringeth forth goodfruits, and one of the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is inſtanced in, which is love; now he doth here ſet by all the other Graces and Duties, in compariſon of faith, becauſe it hath a peculiar nature of receiving a juſtifying righteouſneſs from without, and in denying and rejecting it ſelf, or any doing by us for that end; hence he ſaith, its not any works of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, that is of thoſe that profeſs Juſtification by Works in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, nor of the works of the uncircumciſion, <hi>i.e.</hi> works of the Chriſtian Religion, that ſignifies any thing, but true Faith only; this is the plain meaning of the Apoſtle. As for <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.15. it ſignifies nothing as to our adverſaries. <hi>v.</hi> 14. He ſhewed how his glorying was always in the Croſs of Chriſt, both unto Juſtification and Sanctification; for <hi>to be in Chriſt,</hi> implies both, and he deſires and looks for no other ground of rejoicing

And now it will appear what the ſence of <hi>James</hi> is, The main Scope of the Apoſtle in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. is, to exhort to the impartial exerciſe of Charity to the Saints, and after many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, <hi>v.</hi> 14. he tells us, not to exerciſe Love and Charity is a ſign of a falſe Faith, <hi>ſuch as will not ſave us,</hi> as plainly appears by, <hi>v.</hi> 15.16, 17. Even as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>true faith is that which worketh by love;</hi> ſo he ſaith, that which doth not work by love in the exerciſe of true and faithful charity <hi>is dead faith, being alone, i. e.</hi> having no fruits but an outward Name and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion only; and further, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>How,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wilt thou demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to another perſon that thou haſt faith, thou ſaiſt to another, I have faith, but ſaith that other, demonſtrate it to me by thy works, that it may appear to me by thy works, I will ſhew thee my works, whereby thou ſhalt conclude I have faith, and juſtifie me and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion before all men that have a queſtion or doubt thereof:</hi> Thou believeſt it may be, by an hiſtorical or dogmatical faith, as to ſome things, ſo do the Devils: <hi>But</hi> (v. 20.) <hi>wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead, i. e.</hi> wilt thou have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it, how dead? It is not juſtifying faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſaving, for all true, ſaving faith is juſtified againſt all objections men can make againſt it. 1. He inſtances in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the obedience of <hi>Abraham</hi> to God was a ground of mens ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of <hi>Abraham</hi> as a true Believer, provided his action was good obedience which ſeemed ſo unnatural, wherefore God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf witneſſeth to his obedience, as good, and an eminent effect of true Faith, therefore he was juſtified by works, not as to his ſtate before God, for he was in a juſtified ſtate before, but firſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his obedience were good, all men muſt juſtifie <hi>Abraham</hi> to be an eminent Believer. Again, God bore witneſs to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s obedience as good, therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified to be a true Believer from his works. So that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified as to his faith, as true, good and eminent, by his, or from his obedience; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, thou ſeeſt how his faith co-works with his works, <hi>i. e.</hi> he did theſe actions in faith, and faith car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41447:132"/>him on to ſuch works, his faith was perfected thereby, <hi>i. e.</hi> as a Tree that hath its fruits growing upon it, all true faith thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flouriſhing in that manner. He inſiſts upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s again, and tells us, That the Scripture was fulfilled, [or is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be true] in two great things. 1. That it ſaith, <hi>he was juſtified by faith,</hi> i. e. <hi>he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> what was imputed, his faith? No, it was the bleſſing in the Promiſe, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he believed. 2. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>his faith worked by love,</hi> therefore it was not a dead faith; he was called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> he was from the greatneſs of love he had to God, ready to yield any obedience to God, thence the Apoſtle denies not, that he was juſtified by faith only, as to his Perſon, but that God declared and witneſſed alſo to his obedience, as approved of by him, which in the ſence the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of, was a Juſtification as to his Faith, and the goodneſs of it in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acts of obedience, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>you ſee therefore that a man is juſtified by works,</hi> [a man may have an approbation of his works, and a commendation from God for them] <hi>and not of his faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> [God may commend and approve of a mans works as well as his faith, for indeed it is a Juſtification by <hi>way of commendation and approbation</hi> of a mans faith and works which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> here ſpeaks of.] Likewiſe <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Rahab the harlot was ſhe not juſtified by works [i. e.</hi> did ſhe not approve her ſelf to be a true Believer?] <hi>when ſhe received the meſſengers, and had ſent them out another way.</hi> The World would be apt to condemn this action of <hi>Rahab,</hi> as treachery to her Native Country, and therefore God juſtifies her in this particular action, that it was good, being done in faith, God witneſſeth to it in his Word, and juſtifies her as a Believer, <hi>in foro mundi,</hi> by this eminent act of her, <hi>v.</hi> 26. whence having given theſe inſtances, he concludes, <hi>as a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpirit is dead, ſo is faith without works dead;</hi> and that was the thing which he undertook to prove, that faith, <hi>i. e. ſuppoſed</hi> or <hi>profeſſed,</hi> is dead, if it be fruitleſs; hence, he ſaith, Believers have been juſtified to be ſo by God, in giving Teſtimony to their works, as true fruits of ſaving faith. Wherefore we may conclude, that <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are agreed in all. 1. That <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of faith in general, a Profeſſion of Chriſtian Faith, and that ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is empty and profitable to our ſelves and others, as alſo dead in it ſelf, if it is not juſtified by good works; ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> often ſpeaks of ſaving faith, and our Saviour Chriſt, that we can have no better Argument of each others truth of faith than the fruit growing upon the tree, this is without queſtion to <hi>v.</hi> 19. 2. He proves it in that they were true Believers, had
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41447:133"/>a double Juſtification. 1: By Faith only, and here he concurs with <hi>Paul</hi> concerning his Juſtification before God, <hi>v.</hi> 23. and yet he had ſuch a faith as wrought by love, for the Scripture calls him <hi>the friend of God.</hi> 2. That there is a Juſtification of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as to a particular act, as well as his Perſon and State, and therefore the inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering his Son, and <hi>Rahab</hi> is brought in, and this is that Juſtification which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not ſo much of, but the Spirit of God doth in ſeveral caſes, as <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> God teſtifying ſome way to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices <hi>in foro mundi,</hi> and ſo <hi>Job,</hi> whom God juſtified againſt the unjuſt charges of his Friends; ſo <hi>Phineas</hi> his zeal for the glory of God in the matter of <hi>Cosbi,</hi> that ſeemed a raſh and mutinous piece of Uſurpation. God juſtified him in it, declared his high approbation thereof. Hence <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>faith that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ſalvation,</hi> at large, and condemns that as falſe and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, that is not fruitful. 2. He ſpeaks of Juſtification at large, which is by faith <hi>in foro divino,</hi> before God, and <hi>in foro humano,</hi> before Men; by works and fruits of faith, that <hi>in foro divino,</hi> is by faith only without works. 1. In that he ſaith, no works of ours can anſwer God's law, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>He that keeps,</hi> or pretends to keep, <hi>the whole law, and offends in one point, is guilty of all;</hi> whence ariſeth this unanſwerable Argument, <hi>They that cannot keep the whole law of God without offending in out point, can never be juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by works, but none can do ſo,</hi> Ergo. 2. He aſſerts Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith before God in the inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith, uſing the ſame Expreſſion, and doth not deny this to be true Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and full before God, but only <hi>Abraham</hi> brought forth the fruits before Men, from his faith working by love he is called <hi>the friend of God;</hi> thus God juſtified him in his obedience as a true Believer, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he concludes, as all true faith, ſo true ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith hath ſuch fruit. 3. <hi>James</hi> ſhews how God often bears witneſs and approves of particular actions which men are ready to condemn, ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering up his Son, and <hi>Rahab</hi>'s giving up the City, and ſuch a Teſtimony that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it by faith in Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs; for no other are approved of by God as Goſpel-Works, and thus you have the full ſcope of <hi>James,</hi> not contradicting the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> at all, but ſpeaking only of another Juſtification <hi>in foro humano,</hi> in the effects that Men ſee, and the approbation that God gives.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Hence I anſwer Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> who ſaith, the ſame Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is intended by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> I ſay, <hi>James</hi> intends the ſame Juſtification before God, <hi>in foro Dei, aut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41447:133"/>far as he ſpeaks of Juſtification by Faith, but when he ſpeaks of the ſame perſons juſtification by works, it intends only Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his approbation of the particular Acts of obedience and bearing witneſs thereto, of the true faith in <hi>foro humano</hi> by word or evidences, as in that whole of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. And in divers other Scripture <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Juſtification of a mans perſon;</hi> It is true and here its aſcribed to his faith, the righteouſneſs he receives by faith is imputed to him, but the faith is not all the approbation that he hath, not all his Juſtification he is alſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>coram hominibus.</hi> He doth not ſay works were imputed to him for righteouſneſs? But he and his works for his perſon, then his obedience being accepted by God in Chriſt, God witneſſeth before men to his faith and obedience, and to his faith by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his obedience. So that he ſpeaks both of the Juſtification of his perſon and of his faith too but in divers reſpects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Can his faith ſave him, Implying, that tho faith without works cannot ſave, yet faith with works will; for Saved, and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, both belong to the ſame Subject.</hi>

               <p>Sect. 1. HAving written hitherto in way of defence, againſt the Adverſaries of our Juſtification by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and having in ſome meaſure (as I truſt) the mind of the Spirit, I dare not let theſe Adverſaries paſs without uſing the Sword of the Spirit, to the wounding their Doctrine even in its very Vitals, by home thruſts and downright blows. For the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt who is come forth upon his white Horſe, with a Bow and a Crown, will not return till he hath conquered all the Enemies of this glorious Righteouſneſs of his, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over them. I have chearfully thro' grace taken this Service in hand, under the Captain of my Salvation, thro whoſe ſtrength and aſſiſtance I hope for ſucceſs to his praiſe and glory.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41447:135"/>I ſhall in the firſt place prove that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the only righteouſneſs that a Sinner is juſtified by before God, and the Arguments are theſe briefly:</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That is the righteouſneſs only that a ſinner can be juſtified by, which fulfils that law which he hath broken; But Chriſts Righteouſneſs is ſuch: For the <hi>minor</hi> our adverſaries would have us believe that they mean ſo, however, they often talk of ſatisfaction to the Law, their ſincerity therein will be tried in due time. As to the <hi>major</hi> its indubitable to any man of ſence, that its not another law can excuſe him from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the law which he hath broken; nor a righteouſneſs of another law, eſpecially ſuch as is imperfect and faulty, that will ſerve the turn. God never abandoned nor relaxed his original Law, (though others as branches in poſitive laws for a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be) but that was perfectly fulfilled in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. That Righteouſneſs which merits the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sinner before God, is that righteouſneſs only by which, and for which he is juſtified before God; but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is ſuch, <hi>Ergo.</hi> For the <hi>minor</hi> our adverſaries grant it, that Chriſt merited and purchaſed our Juſtification, <hi>i. e.</hi> by works of our own, and that our Righteouſneſs and Juſtification are effects thereof, and therefore there needs no further Proof here; but we muſt come to the <hi>major</hi> which pincheth hard upon them; but it appears to be true, 1. Becauſe there is no legal Diſcharge of an accuſed perſon, without a meritorious righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appearing; Now theſe men, with the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay (ſome at leaſt, and others do but liſp at it, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays it downright, he knowing it to be inſeparable from the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine) that their righteouſneſs is not meritorious, being imperfect, if it be not, its no juſtifying righteouſneſs; I will ſtand by it, that there is no righteouſneſs can claim Juſtification but upon the merit of their action in the performance of the preceptive part, and if they be juſtified by the new law, they muſt be juſtified by the merits thereof; but we aſſert that the righteouſneſs muſt anſwer the old law broken, and it muſt be, as in Juſtice it doth ſo ſatisfie that law, that it lays claim to Juſtification by vertue of thoſe merits, and no other righteouſneſs will paſs there, but what is ſuch.</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The righteouſneſs typified by the Prieſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of old, was the righteouſneſs whereby a ſinner is juſtifi d in the ſight of God; but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt a-alone is ſuch, <hi>Ergo.</hi> For the <hi>major</hi> our adverſaries, Mr. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſay, that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is the thing for which <hi>id propter quod,</hi> not as the End but as an Inſtrument of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41447:135"/>the Efficient, and a meritorious cauſe, and our Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the <hi>per quam,</hi> which they ſay doth not denote Merit, and in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſence <hi>per quam</hi> denotes only inſtrumentality; but indeed here's theſe mens Commutation, they make Chriſt's Righteouſneſs the Inſtrument, and that remote enough too, and our own righteouſneſs the Formal Cauſe of Juſtification, which in truth is their meritorious cauſe; upon their own Poſitions the <hi>major</hi> muſt be granted. The <hi>minor</hi> will be very demonſtrable upon theſe reaſons, That the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is only ſuch, the <hi>id propter quod,</hi> and <hi>per quod</hi> a ſinner is juſtified in Gods ſight. 1. <hi>i. e.</hi> The righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified, is not two, but one, and Chriſts is that, as the Scripture affirms. 2. That for which a man is meritoriouſly juſtified <hi>in tribuno legis,</hi> is that by which he is juſtified; ſo the law knows no difference in thoſe terms, for it doth nothing by any righteouſneſs but it doth it for that righteouſneſs. 3. The Spirit of God therefore uſeth the <hi>Greek</hi> Prepoſitions, promiſeuouſly in this caſe, as hath in part been ſhewed. 4.

The Righteouſneſs typified by the Prieſtly Sacrifices of old, was the righteouſneſs whereby a ſinner is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God, but this was the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt only, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> are ſo clear that no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that hath read the Scripture with any underſtanding, can deny either; if any ſhall ſay, its not eaſie to defend it, there's the whole Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yea, the whole Scripture to prove them; all the Devils in Hell cannot caſt down this Fortreſs, and I leave it therefore to the intelligent Reader, let him ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they teſtifie of it.</p>

That Righteouſneſs which is a ranſoming and redeeming righteouſneſs from a legal Bondage is the juſtifying righteouſneſs of a ſinner before God, but Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is that alone which is a redeeming and ranſoming righteouſneſs, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is true, none that call themſelves Chriſtians dare to fly ſo audaciouſly in the face of Chriſt, and deny plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to deny this, if they do, there's enough to prove it, to the meaneſt Chriſtian; The <hi>major</hi> therefore, I will prove beyond all contradiction; That righteouſneſs which meritoriouſly diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the ſinner from his Bondage under the Law, the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and curſe of it, is juſtifying Righteouſneſs; but Chriſts Righteouſneſs is ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and divers places, for a diſcharge of a perſon from under the Bonds, Impriſonments, and Curſe of the Law, is his Juſtification, and the righteouſneſs for which he is diſcharged is his Juſtification:</p>

               <p>§. 7. <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. That Righteouſneſs which only can juſtifie a Sinner againſt the Law, is the Righteouſneſs whereby a Sinner is Juſtifyed in the ſight of God, but Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is ſuch. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I ſuppoſe the <hi>major</hi> is undeniable, except men will cavil at the Sun at noon day, and will any have the face to ſay, as to the <hi>minor,</hi> 1. That God hath not purer Eyes of Juſtice than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Iniquity, 2. That he exerciſeth juſtice by halves and not in the ſtricteſt and exacteſt manner, 3.

A Sinners unrighteouſneſs is ſuch, that the Law could never look upon him for to be righteouſs in the ſight of God in his own righteouſneſs, becauſe, he hath been once a tranſgreſſor. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>If a man transgreſs but in one Point he is guilty of all.</hi> The Saints in Heaven tho glorified with Perfection, yet having been ſinners and tranſgreſſors of the Law, they could not ſtand Juſtifyed out of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, It is one thing to have perfection of Sanctification as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtanding and performances, and another thing to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Juſtification, wherein the leaſt believer here on Earth are as perfectly Juſtifyed and as righteous before God as the glorifyed Saints in Heaven.

That Righteouſneſs which repairs all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſes loſt in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> is the only righteouſneſs whereby we are Juſtifyed before God: but Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſuch and no other righteouſneſs. <hi>Ergo,</hi> as to the <hi>major,</hi> for all other righteouſneſs comes ſhort of what we loſt in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> our unrighteouſneſs was our breach of the preceptive part of Gods Law, this was our unrighteouſneſs, our loſs and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was alſo very great, in reſpect of moral original righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and coming under the wages of ſin which is death or liableneſs thereto by the Law in all acceptations.

               <p>§. 9. <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. That Righteouſneſs whereby a Sinner is at peace with God, reconciled to him, and hath acceſs unto his preſence with boldneſs, is the Righteouſneſs whereby he is Juſtified: but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is ſuch, the <hi>minor</hi> is evident. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20.

Doth Chriſt plead our righteouſneſs or his own? Not ours ſure, he pleads for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our ſervices thro' his righteouſneſs, he entred into the holyeſt of all with his blood. What was it to procure?

               <p>§. 11. <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. If there be no name of any other, nor Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other among men beſides Chriſt's, than there's no righteouſneſs for Juſtification of a Sinner but Chriſt's; but the <hi>antecedent</hi> is true, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.12. the place ſo full and expreſs there's no diſputing it. But our <hi>Neonomians</hi> will deny the antecedent; for this is the ſtone that is ſet at naught by our new Goſpel builders; they will ſay that there's juſtification righteouſneſs in men, and in the name of themſelves and their own righteouſneſs they ſhall be Juſtified; but then I ſay, there's another name, and ſalvation in ſome other among men, if that juſtifying righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is our ſalvation only. For what is in Chriſt, is it not in them? And tho Chriſt purchaſed it, the ſalvation is in them not in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 12. <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. If Chriſt be the end of the law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to every one that believeth, then his righteouſneſs is the only Juſtifying righteouſneſs, but Chriſt is ſo, the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. all the aim and deſign of God in his law in making it, is that it may be anſwered in righteouſneſs, Chriſt is this end as to all ſaved ones, and as to believers; he ſaid not, that we are the end of the law by our own righteouſneſs, or that Chriſt merited that we ſhould be the end of the law, or ſhou'd be the righteouſneſs of a new law, but Chriſt is ſo; if their had been any other end for righteouſneſs, he would have told us of it. The conſequence needs no proof for whatever fully anſwer the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41447:137"/>end of the law in active and paſſive obedience for us, is juſtifying righteouſneſs in the eye of the law, it looks for no more; but the <hi>Neonomians</hi> will ſay, here is the old law meant, and Chriſt anſwered that, I ſay, then if he did juſtify us as to Old law righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, a fig for the New law and the pretended Juſtification thereby.</p>
               <p>§. 13. <hi>Arg.</hi> 12. That righteouſneſs which in a lively manner is held forth in the ſeals of the Covenant, and as ſeals of the righteouſneſs of faith is juſtifying righteouſneſs: but that is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Ergo.</hi> For the <hi>minor</hi> thats plain, the waſhing with water held forth his waſhing us from our ſins in his blood; the eating the bread and drinking the wine, it is to ſignify our feeding upon the Body of Chriſt by Faith, on which he bore our ſins, and drinking of his Blood which he ſhed for the remiſſion of Sins. As to the <hi>major</hi> its plain they hold forth Chriſt to be our juſtifying righteouſneſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. and that we live upon this righteouſneſs (as the Lord's Supper holds forth in a ſpiritual eating the Body and drinking his Blood,) do we ſhew forth our own death or life of works or his? that they ſhould be ſeals of our own righteouſneſs and not of Chriſts.</p>
               <p>§. 14. <hi>Arg.</hi> 13. If no righteouſneſs but a Suretiſhip, and Preiſtly righteouſneſs can juſtify a Sinner before God, then Chriſt's righteouſneſs alone can do it, but nothing but a Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Prieſtly righteouſneſs can, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is proved becauſe we are Bankrouts have nothing to pay, neither in our ſelves by nature, nor beſtowed on us, that which the holieſt man hath in ſanctification bearing no proportion to our ſins and God's demands, therefore it muſt be the righteouſneſs of a Surety, that's holy, harmleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that pays a righteouſneſs for us <hi>adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi> to the demands of the Law. The conſequence will hold becauſe there was no other Surety to God for Sinners, but Chriſt; he hath engaged to pay for us, and hath paid and his payment accepted. <hi>His Blood was ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins, he was the great high Prieſt, and as ſuch he was a Surety.</hi> Heb. 7.21.22. ch. 2.17.</p>
               <p>§. 15. <hi>Arg.</hi> 14. If there be no Goſpel righteouſneſs in reſpect of a Sinner but Chriſt's righteouſneſs, then Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is our Juſtifying righteouſneſs; but there's no Goſpel righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. The <hi>minor</hi> is thus proved, The righteouſneſs by which a Sinner is Juſtified is Goſpel. 1. Becauſe its not wrought by himſelf but by another for him. 2. Becauſe its given to him freely; its a Law righteouſneſs in reſpect of Chriſt: Now when by our graces and duties we claim Juſtification as due to us upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming conditions, we make all our works legal and put them in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41447:137"/>the room of Chriſt's righteouſneſs for Juſtification. The conſequence is clear becauſe a Sinner can be ſaved only by a Goſpel righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that of Chriſt that is offer'd him, and he receives as the Goſpel glad tidings, for its good news and Goſpel to any man, to hear of one that is able and willing to pay his debt for him.</p>
               <p>§. 16. <hi>Arg.</hi> 15. If there be no life to be given to a Sinner by the righteouſneſs of any law perform'd by him, then the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the only righteouſneſs that he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by; but there is no life to be given to any Sinner, by the righteouſneſs of any law perform'd by him, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> is fully proved by the <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. where Law is uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, in both parts of the Texts as well the laſt as the firſt, and it ſhould have been rendred thus, <hi>if there had been a Law given which could have given Life, then Righteouſneſs had been by a Law;</hi> therefore this place is fully excluſive of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs by a new Law, and God never made ſuch a Law. The conſequence is clear if all other Law righteouſneſs but Chriſt's be excluded, then Chriſt's righteouſneſs is that alone by which a Sinner is Juſtified. Theſe <hi>Arguments</hi> are ſtrong and enough to prove what we aſſert, and againſt all the World if the Scripture and Reaſon enlightned thereby may take place. The Scripture is ſo full of proof, that theſe Sixteen might be made Sixty, but brevity is call'd for, by the circumſtances that attend Printing.</p>

               <p>Section 1. OUr Adverſaries ſay they own the <hi>Imputation of Righteouſneſs to Juſtification;</hi> but they ſay, its there own, not Chriſt's: Now we ſhall prove that Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is Imputed. They ſay, its no where ſaid that Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41447:138"/>is Imputed. We ſay, it is in all that is ſaid by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo plain, that all but he that will ſhut his Eyes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly muſt ſee it. I ſhall but give brief hints of it, 1. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4. ſpeaking ſo often of Imputation, gives us plainly to underſtand, that he means no Imputation but of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to Juſtification; for his Diſcourſe in the 4th <hi>chap.</hi> is continued from <hi>ver.</hi> 25. of the 3d to prove the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification by the Propitiation, Blood and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt; and ſhews how Faith honours this Righteouſneſs, and wrongs not the law by it, but eſtabliſheth it. In the 4th <hi>ch.</hi> he goes on to exclude all Juſtification by any works, and ſhews in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> they took Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. <hi>viz.</hi> that ſpoken <hi>ch.</hi> 3.25. by Faith, for their Imputed righteouſneſs, unto juſtification and remiſſion, and covering of them from the Eye of God's juſtice; wherefore Chriſt is call'd our Propitiation, in alluſion to the Golden cover of the Ark, that hid the Law and was the mercy ſeat; now briefly to ſhew that by Imputation ſo often mention'd in this <hi>chap.</hi> he meant the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to our Juſtification he tells us <hi>ver.</hi> 22. that what God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which he was fully by Faith perſwaded of, was Imputed to him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; now ſaith the Apoſtle, it was not written for the ſake of <hi>Abraham</hi> only, but for us alſo to whom it ſhall be Imputed, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Righteouſneſs in the Promiſe; if we believe on him, that raiſed up the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the dead, who was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our offences and raiſed again for our Juſtification <hi>i. e.</hi> if we believe in God, thro' the full perfect and compleat righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, for our Righteouſneſs could not have been full and compleat without his Reſurrection, and his Juſtification as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick head of all the Elect; who raiſed was Juſtified, as having wrought out a full and compleat Juſtifying righteouſneſs for them, they are incouraged and invited to take it for their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Faith, and they might aſſure themſelves of the Imputation thereof; and proceeds in the next <hi>chap.</hi> to ſay, that having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Imputed righteouſneſs by Faith, they are ſaid to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Faith, and to have peace with God, and acceſs unto the grace of God thro the ſaid righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Now then I Argue, if Chriſt in the promiſe be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Righteouſneſs to <hi>Abraham</hi> and every believer, and the Apoſtle ſaith ſo, then the Imputation here ſpoken of, is the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs; but the <hi>antecedent</hi> is true, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21, 22. its plain, that it was what God had promiſed to him was Imputed to him. The conſequence needs no proof, for it was Chriſt was promiſed, and he ſaw Chriſt's day in that promiſe,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41447:138"/>and the Promiſe of Chriſt was the Goſpel preached to him.</p>
               <p>Again, to prove the Apoſtle means the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed, <hi>If the delivery of Chriſt for our ſins, and raiſing him again for Juſtification, was the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for Juſtification; then this is that which was imputed not to</hi> Abraham <hi>for righteouſneſs only, but alſo to every Believer by the Text;</hi> and therefore the <hi>minor</hi> is fully there proved; and I think as to the <hi>major,</hi> that none can deny the Life, Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt to be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. <hi>He that was made of God righteouſneſs to us is made by imputation of his righteouſneſs to us; but Chriſt is made ſo of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. but ſaith Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> he is made righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as he is made <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> So <hi>Righteouſneſs, Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> but it follows not only that he be made of great advantage to a Chriſtian, but theſe ſeveral ways, that he is not one thing as the other; he is not a Prophet as a Prieſt; and if he ſhould mean <hi>made righteouſneſs</hi> in Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s. ſence, then he ſhould be but made <hi>ſanctification</hi> twice taken, for Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s juſtifying righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is but Sanctification; its, he is made the Spring, Head and Root of Sanctification, and legally made <hi>righteouſneſs to us.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Again, <hi>If we be made the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt,</hi> [where its plain this righteouſneſs of God is in Chriſt] <hi>then the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us, but we are made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him, Ergo.</hi> the <hi>antecedent</hi> is proved by, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. as to the <hi>major,</hi> the <hi>Neonomians</hi> ſay, the righteouſneſs of God is our own righteouſneſs: We ſay, nay, the righteouſneſs of God is ſaid to be in Chriſt, and we are made ſo by imputation, for Chriſt could not be made Sin for us, but by Imputation, and if it is meant of a Sacrifice for Sin, even ſuch were made Sin by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore we are made the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt by Imputation.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Again, <hi>If Chriſt hath merited our Juſtification, Chriſts Merits are imputed in themſelves to Juſtification; but Chriſt hath merited our Juſtification:</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is granted by theſe Gentlemen: They tell us, that Chriſts Merits are <hi>id propter quod,</hi> we are juſtified for the ſake, or rather by reaſon of Chriſts Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but they mean not that Chriſt purchaſed the Sinner's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd condition of the New law, but that he procured of God a new law for man to perform the condition of: Now this is no more to be the cauſe of Juſtification, than God in making a Law was a cauſe of Sin; for ſin is not Imputed where there's no law; and where there is a Law, there will be Juſtification or Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Chriſt merited a Law and made one, therefore for the ſake of Chriſt, we are Juſtified by this Law; here's Chriſts law
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41447:139"/>
                  <hi>cauſa ſine qua non</hi> with a Witneſs. As to the conſequence, if Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be an effect of Merits, and it be a Juridical effect, then Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which is the cauſe, muſt be imputed to the perſon on whom theſe effects muſt fall: What moves the Court or Judge to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify this or that perſon, his own Merits or the Merits of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Not his own, but the Merits of another: Then theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are imputed, for it quickly and plainly appears what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to any, whether merits of Condemnation or merits of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, for Juſtice goes by nothing but Merit; and therefore mens own righteouſneſs cannot juſtify-becauſe it cannot Merit: And do not our <hi>Neonomians</hi> ſpeak as the <hi>Socinians</hi> in this point, and mumble as if their mouths were full of plumbs? Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if Chriſts Merit be brought into Court, as a meritorious cauſe of the Sinners Juſtification, they are imputed to him for his Juſtification as if he had merited himſelf.</p>
               <p>§. <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. They ſay, <hi>Chriſts Merits cannot be Imputed, but the Effects are Imputed.</hi> And I Argue, If Chriſts Righteouſneſs be Imputed, its Imputed as a cauſe of Juſtification, or in the Effect; [It ſhould be as an Effect or the Disjunction is ridiculous] but its not Imputed in the Effect, <hi>Ergo.</hi> In and as the Cauſe, for the Effect is not the Cauſe but contrary, its another thing; ſo that to ſay Chriſts Merits are imputed, and ſo imputed to the perſon Juſtified is nonſenſe. But what are the effects imputed? All the Benefits purchaſed by Chriſt. For is Juſtification an effect impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Sure not. Is Juſtification imputed to Juſtification? Sure that's moſt abſur'd. Is Mortification imputed to Juſtification? That looks very odd. Is Vocation and Adoption, or Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all or any of them Imputed to Juſtification? for they are Effects of Chriſts Merits. But ſuppoſe they ſay, ſome of theſe or all, are to us imputed for righteouſneſs unto Juſtification; I then Query, Whether the Righteouſneſs perform'd by us in the new law Juſtification, be merited by Chriſt as an Effect? Do not I ſee them ſneak away now and give no Anſwer, but upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subject, they will tell you that Faith and the condition of the New law, was not purchaſed by Chriſt, but are by the gift of Election only. And now I pray what's become of Juſtification, by Effects of Chriſts Merits? They will ſay, we are Juſtified by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Spirits operations to us for righteouſneſs. Now this cannot be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit never was incarnate, nor his Office to work a Righteouſneſs for Juſtification; this was peculiar to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fruits of the Spirit, when they come to be exerted, are called our works, and juſtly ſo, becauſe Graces exerciſed, or Duties performed by us are ſo, theſe are all renounced as ſuch by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> Phil. 3.8. and elſewhere.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:41447:139"/>
               <p n="3">3. What the Spirit doth in Juſtification, its office is by way of Application, it takes of Chriſts, and gives it to us; it applies and brings home to a ſinner the Impetration of Chriſt, as Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto his Juſtification; hence the Spirit is ſaid to juſtifie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. in bringing to the Soul the Grace of Juſtification, and enſtating him therein by faith, as he ſanctifies by bringing in the Grace of Sanctification. Now then, if Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be imputed in the effect, and is imputed at all, then as the cauſe meritorious of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>But they ſay, God cannot impute Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, becauſe we did not perform it, and God is a God of Truth, he cannot impute that to us which we did not. To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God doth not reckon we performed Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God may give us his Son for righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and give us this righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He may accept it for us on law terms, as our righteouſneſs to Juſtification, and all this is according to Truth and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputing it to us in a Law Senſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Argument will fall upon <hi>Neonomian</hi> Juſtification, for that's to call that righteouſneſs which is unrighteouſneſs, and not according to Truth, as hath been ſhewed: Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> makes it a great Argument that the active righteouſneſs of Chriſt muſt not be imputed, becauſe Chriſt did not obey that we ſhould not obey, and where's the <hi>Antinomian</hi> that ſays ſo? but we ſay, that Chriſt did and ſuffered all that the law required of him as a Second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and our Surety, and his obeying in doing is no hindrance, but a Goſpel ground and reaſon of our doing and obeying: As Chriſt did not ſuffer that we ſhould not ſuffer, but not ſuffer the Penally, ſo Chriſts doing was not that we ſhould not obey Evangelically, but that we ſhould but not obey legally, with expectation of our Juſtification by our works, or from a law, for that is to be under a Law, and not under Grace, and to ſin inſtead of obeying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, If Chriſt's righteouſneſs be taken as a meritorious cauſe in a ſinner's Juſtification, it is imputed as ſuch to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon juſtified; the effect of this cauſe is the ſinner's Juſtification, which is his proper Diſcharge, and this is not Imputation, but Judgment upon it, and Delivery in Law, and ſuppoſe the effects of Merit could be imputed, the cauſe and reaſon thereof muſt be firſt imputed; for the Law doth nothing in way of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Juſtification but upon a meritorious cauſe imputed unto Condemnation or Juſtification; and how abſurd is it to ſay Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is imputed, but its proper to ſay, the ſin that merits it is imputed.</p>

               <p>§. 6. <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. That Righteouſneſs which is accepted in law unto Juſtification is imputed to the perſon juſtified, but Chriſt's Merits are accepted of God to the Sinner's Juſtification. The <hi>major</hi> muſt be owned for Truth by the <hi>Neonomians,</hi> otherwiſe they could not aſſert their Juſtification by Works. The <hi>minor</hi> hath been counted ſound Divinity by moſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but whether it be or be not, the Scripture affirms it roundly; ſee for a taſte, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>chap.</hi> 1.6. for an acceptation in law, muſt be an imputation of Merit to Juſtification, and can be upon no other account, either of a man's own, or of another's for him, the law looks at the value of his Money or Works that he brings into Court, not how he came by either, whether by Gift or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. <hi>That righteouſneſs through which Sin is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to condemnation is the righteouſneſs through which a man is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteous unto Juſtification: But Chriſts righteouſneſs is that through which ſin is not imputed to condemnation, Ergo.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is very clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.34. <hi>who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died,</hi> chap. 4.6, 7, 8: <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſins are forgiven, to whom God doth not impute ſin;</hi> and this is told us is a righteouſneſs without works, that which comes on <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> that which covers Sin from the Eye of God's Juſtice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which lies in the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. likewiſe 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world, i. e.</hi> juſtifying, for God reconciles none but by Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; reconciliation is eſſential to it, and therefore <hi>non</hi> imputation of ſin; for while a man lies under a law charge of ſin he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, till he be imputed righteous by the law. The <hi>major</hi> is evident from what is ſaid in proof of the <hi>minor,</hi> for <hi>non</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſin to a ſinner is eſſential to his Juſtification, which can be no otherwiſe then by a covering righteouſneſs; and when a law imputes ſin, the ſame law muſt juſtify by imputing to him an <hi>adequate</hi> and ſatisfactory righteouſneſs.</p>

Now that Chriſts righteouſneſs is not pleadible without Imputation to us, neither by Chriſt in heaven nor by us on earth its plain, for if Chriſt be never ſo righteous, his plea is anſwerered in ſaying thou art righteous for thy ſelf; I never imputed thy righteouſneſs to theſe, let them plead for their own Juſtification. If they plead it with God, the anſwer is, Chriſt is righteous for himſelf; his righteouſneſs not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee, no more then the righteouſneſs of one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and therefore Chriſts righteouſneſs being pleadible its imputed; without Imputation its not pleadible for us or by us.</p>

               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Section 1. <hi>Of the Nature of Faith as ſpoken of.</hi> §. 2. <hi>What this Faith is?</hi> §. 3. <hi>And how we are ſaid to be Justified by Faith.</hi> §. 4. <hi>Arg. To prove that Faith is not our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>Section 1. HAving proved Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to be the only Righteouſneſs for a Sinner's Juſtification in Gods ſight, and that this Righteouſneſs is certainly Imputed to every one that believes; we ſhall in the laſt place enquire, what concern and intreſt Faith hath in our Juſtification? I ſhall not ſpeak of Faith accompanying Salvation at large (as the Apoſtle doth <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: Wherein he alſo comprehends Juſtifying, (among the other Senſes there ſpoken of) but only of Faith as it referrs to) Juſtification and the righteouſneſs thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Juſtifying Faith is a gift of God, whereby a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner believes in God unto eternal life thro Jeſus Chriſt. 1. It is a gift of God, in reſpect of the grace of God and the work of the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. 2. It is a purchaſed benefit for an Elect perſon. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. It's a Gift to a Sinner; there's no grace lives tell Faith, then Chriſt lives in him; its to a poor undone broken Sinner. 4. This is a gift of grace to believe in God and Chriſt; 1. To be perſwaded of the truth of the Law, his certain curſe under it, impoſſibility of coming to the works thereof; That its a ſaying worthy of all acceptance, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave Sinners, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was one of the chiefeſt;</hi> not that he was righteous ſubordinately to Chriſt's to qualify him for it: This is that which is properly call'd <hi>fides,</hi> but its hard to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh this from the Faith of a natural man and hipocrite; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 2. There is believing in <hi>i. e.</hi> reſting upon God and Chriſt, reſting on the faithfulneſs of God in his promiſe of a good thing to us, as for eternal life, and for righteouſneſs in Chriſt; now faithfulneſs belongs to perſons; truth unto things, when the Soul doth not only believe the thing promiſed true, but believes him
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41447:141"/>faithful who hath promiſed, and from thence doth ſtay himſelf and his Soul acquiſce in it. This is properly <hi>fiducia,</hi> truſting in God. 3. There's a particular application of Chriſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and the Soul unto God in Chriſt, believing that all the promiſes, eſpecially thoſe that concern eternal life and juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt's righteouſneſs, are yea and Amen in him, made and perform'd in him.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Hence, by Faith we are ſaid to be juſtified. 1. Becauſe the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the object of our Faith; it is that we believe to, and come unto believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>We believe unto righteouſneſs.</hi> 2. By Faith a man is devorced from the Law and legal righteouſneſs, and comes into a new marriage relation to Chriſt for righteouſneſs and life. Rom. 7.3. Becauſe its that grace only whereby a man can go out of himſelf, and fetch in the righteouſneſs of another. 4. It is that grace which from the very law of its nature which it hath thro grace, doth always deny it ſelf any thing of righteouſneſs for Juſtification and gives all the glory of righteouſneſs unto Chriſt alone. 5. In that it doth <hi>fiducially</hi> reſt and depend thereon believing. 6. It dwells upon an object of righteouſneſs which is not ſeen, by ſence or reaſon, yea it is the hypoſtaſis of Chriſt's righteouſneſs in the Soul; Chriſt lives as it were in our Faith, take away Chriſt from it, and you leave it a dead nothing or worſe, it returns to unbelief. 7. Becauſe by this Faith the Soul ſees God at peace with him, and he hath peace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the controverſy is at an end between God and him, thro this Imputed and believed righteouſneſs. 8. The juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied one as he draws his firſt breath of the new man in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto righteouſneſs, ſo he lives upon this righteouſneſs in all his Chriſtian courſe, in that Chriſts righteouſneſs may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the righteouſneſs of Faith, for Meat and Drink. <hi>John</hi> 6.51, 53. 9. Faith hath hereby all juſtifiable ways to God, Chriſt is thereby his way unto the Father, he can have acceſs to the grace wherein he ſtands, comes thro this righteouſneſs with boldneſs to the Throne of grace, and receives remiſſion of ſins, and every good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift, God having not ſpared his Son, but given him for us, hence he will not withhold any good thing. 10. As it receives all grace in and with juſtifying grace, ſo it gives and aſcribes all to free grace in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, both the gift of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and faith it ſelf, and the life eternal given to ſuch a poor wretch in and thro Jeſus Chriſt. 11. In that this grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with Chriſts righteouſneſs, is leading to all fruits of Chriſts righteouſneſs imputed and believed, all which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41447:142"/>in the exerciſe of all holy affections, graces and duties to the mortification of ſin and growth in obedience and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 14. Now having ſhewed the Excellency of this Grace in its Nature and Kind, we muſt ſhew you that it is not Chriſt, nor muſt not take his Throne or Crown from him, yea abhors no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more if true, but will keep a Believer always a poor, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, broken, and contrite hearted Sinner. Therefore we aſſert, and Chriſt with his whole Word will ſtand by us in it, that our Faith as a Grace of the Spirit or Work of ours is not imputed for Righteouſneſs to Juſtification; I ſhall but Name a few Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments convincing enough, and ſhew thereby the way to others to do the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith is for the Honour of Chriſt our High-Prieſt upon the Throne, if it takes to it ſelf juſtifying Righteouſneſs, it takes the Crown from his Head, and ſets it upon his own for the great end of Chriſt's Humiliation and Exaltation, was the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Faith be our Righteouſneſs, then Faith is its own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when you bid Men believe unto Juſtification, you muſt bid them believe in themſelves; and bid them by Faith go to their Faith for Righteouſneſs and Life, what's Abſurder?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God impute Faith it ſelf as a Work to Juſtification, then Faith muſt be imputed as meritorious of Juſtification. For, 1. Chriſts Righteouſneſs is ſo imputed. 2. No Righteouſneſs can be imputed otherwiſe to Juſtification, but ſuch as is merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of it, Juſtification being a Law-act.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith making it ſelf Righteouſneſs for Juſtification by a Law, makes it ſelf altogether Legal as much as any Works what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, inſomuch, that it is not an evangelical Work, ſo that it ought not to juſtifie as a Work by their own Rule, that we are not juſtified by the legal works, but we have proved all their Works legal.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That that can't cover Sin, and take off the Imputation of it can't be juſtifying Righteouſneſs and take off the the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin, for faith did not die for Sin, or was made a Sacrifice for it to bear the Sin of many.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The Prieſts and Sacrifices of Old were Types of Chriſts Righteouſneſs for Juſtification of a Sinner, not of the Sinners righteouſneſs; and the faithful looked upon themſelves as ſinners Typically juſtified in the Righteouſneſs Typified, and not in their Faith as a Work done.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:41447:142"/>
               <p n="7">7. If our Faith in it ſelf be our Righteouſneſs, then our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is, for that Faith muſt believe that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is not imputed to us for Juſtification, this his high unbelief accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If Faith ſay it juſtifie as a Work, then Faith excludes it ſelf, the very Nature of it; the <hi>Neonomian</hi> ſay, the Law of Faith is the New-law, if ſo, then it excludes it ſelf, for the Law of Faith excludes boaſting, and Works of a Law; <hi>i. e.</hi> the very Nature of Faith, if it be good, is ſo.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If Faith juſtifie as a Work, then Faith juſtifies not without Works, for if it be a Work it ſelf, and juſtifying as ſuch, then it juſtifieth not without Works, becauſe it is a Work, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If Faith be Imputed for Righteouſneſs, then the Blood of Chriſt is not, but we are to be juſtified by the Blood of Chriſt, and the Scripture ſaith, we are, by Faith in his Blood.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If Faith Juſtifies as a Work, then no more is aſcribed to Faith than to other Graces in the concern of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but the Apoſtle aſcribes more concern to Faith than other Graces; and then why doth he oppoſe Faith to Works? Is it not, that its more the Office of Faith as to Juſtification, the <hi>Neonomian</hi> ſay, it is the ſame with other Graces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Cl. Juſtifying Faith is the ſame thing in Subſtance with Effectual Calling, Repentance, Regeneration, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt in the Soul, the new Creature,</hi> &amp;c. Is not a great deal of the Scripture in vain, hath not <hi>Paul</hi> wrote two Epiſtles in vain, where he makes it his Main Buſineſs to beat down Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Works, and oppoſe them to one another, and now he tells us, that Faith and Goſpel Works [<hi>i. e.</hi> legal] are all one.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That which juſtifies as a Righteouſneſs, juſtifies eternally, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. but Faith can't juſtifie eternally, becauſe Faith ceaſeth in Heaven, but juſtifying Righteouſneſs doth not, yea all the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the New-law muſt ceaſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.</p>
               <p n="14">14. That which is not the faederal Condition of the Covenant of Grace, can't be our Righteouſneſs in it ſelf; but Faith is not the faederal Condition, becauſe Faith is promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, given by Grace purchaſed by Chriſt, part of Eternal Life, a means to lay hold of the Condition; but I ſhall not enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this now, only make one Quotation at laſt. Mr. <hi>R. Capel,</hi> who wrote of Temptation, ſaith, ſpeaking of the Conditions of the Covenant. <hi>In this Matter I am of the Opinion of</hi> Kendal, <hi>that the Covenant (he means of Grace) was not made with us, but with Chriſt [this was the Aſſembly's Judgment] for us; and for the main, I am clear of Opinion, that the Covenant of Grace cannot ſtand
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41447:143"/>with any Condition of ours at all, for that I wiſh the Learned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult</hi> Junius. <hi>To deliver my Opinion,</hi> Adam <hi>caſting himſelf out of his Eſtate, the Covenant of Works fell void: Then it pleaſed God to fill up this Room with a New Covenant, commonly called his laſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he bequeathed Grace and Glory on no other Condition that I know of out of the Scriptures, but the Death of the Teſtator,</hi> i. e. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, that as the Firſt Covenant was built on the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the firſt</hi> Adam, <hi>ſo the Second was built on the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſecond. It is beyond my Brain to conceive, that God ſhould immediately make a Covenant with us, who were Children of Diſobedience and of Wrath, who could not be capable of any ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Conditions, but it was with Chriſt for us,</hi> Adam <hi>loſt his Righteouſneſs, the Foundation of the firſt Covenant, but the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt the Second can never be loſt, and therefore the ſecond Covenant or rather Teſtament, can never be broken or diſanulled,</hi> Condition of the Covenant, <hi>p.</hi> 260.</p>
